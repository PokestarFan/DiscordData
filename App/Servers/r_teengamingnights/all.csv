558107083749326848,Altii,general,147,the general channel in teenserv is one of the worst. Everything is moving by at the speed of light_ half the people there are meming or starbaiting
558107201982431253,Goodra,general,18,What's starbaiting
558107287605084180,Goodra,general,38,Also newteens goes by a lot slower tbh
558107308878463026,Altii,general,107,It's when people post things for the sole purpose of getting someone to add the ‚≠ê reaction to their message
558107405930594317,Altii,general,106,because there's a starboard channel and if you get 9 people to react with ‚≠ê your message gets posted there
558107427736780811,Altii,general,10,it's awful
558107434984407059,Goodra,general,21,That's stupid as fuck
558107448905302027,Altii,general,20,all of it is garbage
558107493407129631,Goodra,general,47,Literally just get 8 alts if you care that much
558107500897894420,Goodra,general,13,It's not hard
558107644712321031,jinx,general,64,time to attempt contact with mc friend i haven't seen since 2013
558107659044257802,Altii,general,45,The entire concept of stars I think is stupid
558107693865369621,jinx,general,36,alright skype_ don't slow down my pc
558107742246666244,Altii,general,112,There's already an entire subreddit where you can post shitty memes and low-effort content_ why spam it here too
558107968407601191,Goodra,general,2,Gl
558109669017518092,Jrhotrod,general,101,hey lads_ i don't have anyone to play with and was wondering if anyone would play w a lonely soul lol

558116002400043008,[Beta] Pr1y_NK,general,28,Lmk if you need a casters :p
558118057445425182,RJ,general,12,oh yeah me 2
558427423046107167,Pencyl,general,39,"I didn't know killing him was illegal"
558427441211768834,radar6255,general,36,idk us arguing aint going to do much
558427481833734186,rcfan34,general,28,yes_ you're absolutely right
558427510925164554,rcfan34,general,34,I did not know it would destroy it
558427547201962014,Pencyl,general,57,rc_ you aren't getting unbanned because you "didn't know"
558427574481584144,Pencyl,general,26,all you can do is be sorry
558427601941561345,rcfan34,general,36,I know_ I just want to state my case
558427614415552512,radar6255,general,77,the only way to find out though is to explicitly ask if bed bombs are enabled
558427644086059018,radar6255,general,26,otherwise you wouldnt know
558427830589980733,rcfan34,general,28,because its not in the rules
558427842812051503,Pencyl,general,142,riley_ everyone talks about it in chat and if you have one and you know it's a weapon in the nether and the end you probably know it goes boom
558428022131392542,rcfan34,general,100,I know it goes boom_ its just that I saw it happen in the same exact place and nothing was destroyed
558428084810809345,rcfan34,general,32,which is why I thought it was ok
558428124400844857,Ninobf,general,52,seems a bit weird to ban him for three days for that
558428132747771904,Pencyl,general,64,because this server is stupid and locked blocks make it not boom
558428154897891335,Pencyl,general,37,still doesn't make what you did right
558428177332961300,rcfan34,general,36,yeah but it was the exact same place
558428181292515339,rcfan34,general,2,so
558428202033348618,rcfan34,general,21,why it go boom for me
558428212577697806,legacyfaun9508,general,25,There‚Äôs a fire in who boi
558428214242836501,rcfan34,general,16,and not for them
558428235164024877,Pencyl,general,31,because theo unlocked his stuff
558428251530461184,Pencyl,general,25,so people will get banned
558428273110024212,Pencyl,general,8,like you
558428273621729303,rcfan34,general,34,there's a building with fire on it
558428302575140884,rcfan34,general,20,but thats part of it
558428328629895188,rcfan34,general,14,its the casino
558428340546043907,rcfan34,general,16,its not finished
558428381050306561,rcfan34,general,18,fire spread is off
558428426185474058,legacyfaun9508,general,28,O I feel like an idiot now üòÇ

558429296268541972,Zoutelande_,general,33,also you should stop tagging mods
558429550464466945,Scarecrow,general,45,Can someone check how much longer I‚Äôm banned?
558429651501056020,radar6255,general,58,if you try to log in i think it will tell you not positive
558429750285303829,UserTaken,general,39,no_ it just tells him why he was banned
558429829800656901,radar6255,general,65,that should make it tell you how long you got left thats big dumb
558429955604873227,rcfan34,general,38,I know but I just want Connors opinion
558429973032206362,Scarecrow,reports,22,Yea I wanna appeal too
558430041021743104,Zoutelande_,general,83,and tbh stopping bedbomb destruction would just make blast protection armor usefull

558452462046937088,sws,general,142,So we can get actual DEMOCRACY on this server instead of NSA + mods doing whatever they want the server to be instead of what the players want
558452995449290753,connor,general,22,<@!208334477372555264>

558453131059527691,connor,general,3,No!
558453136906387459,Bantsy,general,96,I bet if I would do something Theo did I would get banned without probability of an appeal ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

558453156950835214,sws,general,114,Im gonna start up a survey on google forums so the mods can know what people want them to do about pvp and the hub
558453208624922655,connor,general,91,You haven't applied to the **TeenGamingNights Survival Games** yet_ <@!208334477372555264>.

558453820162834445,macklemore,general,2,NO
558453840953868302,macklemore,general,11,he appealed
558453861027807233,macklemore,general,30,and got unbanned within reason
558453865847062548,Bantsy,general,3,Wth
558453866417487893,macklemore,general,5,chill
558453872666869780,connor,general,5,Okay!
558453880367611934,connor,general,7,Closed!
558454023112491034,Bantsy,general,32,What was the reason of unbanning
558454601351954452,UserTaken,general,35,what the player count up to connor?
558454619861417984,sws,general,35,I dont think the mods can tell that
558454772261322762,Ninobf,general,8,Bullshit
558455107185016853,Bantsy,general,21,Yeah fucking bullshit
558455109399347230,sws,general,76,I feel like the mods need to change the nether hub_ its a shithole as of now
558455120422109186,Bantsy,general,22,Nobody wants him there
558455160259608577,UserTaken,general,7,^ facts
558455187162005531,sws,general,31,The mods hate democracy i guess
558455286164357120,Bantsy,general,96,<@!281923324131672075> if you‚Äôre going to send a message atleast reply to my question ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
558455319697686538,sws,general,93,Well i guess its not all of the mods but i think NSA needs to listen to what the players want
558455382448799744,macklemore,general,33,<@272432382169055235> he appealed
558455392699547688,macklemore,general,16,thats the reason
558455403940413480,sws,general,87,The nether hub should be protected from pvp entirely_ and bedbombing should be bannable
558455405156761610,macklemore,general,18,thats all you need
558455413843165184,macklemore,general,2,is
558455415428612096,macklemore,general,6,appeal
558455567434252350,sws,general,59,Its useless since players like theo and o8f camp down there
558455665920704538,sws,general,73,Im pretty sure thats a bannable offense to camp around a place for people
558455970473312260,sws,general,85,Rule 1c. "Witch-hunting_ threatening_ harassment_ and targeting users is not allowed"
558456035187228672,Ninobf,general,17,Thats not in game
558456039679197204,UserTaken,general,43,calling that a witch hunt is a real stretch
558456110701346848,sws,general,50,Not a witch hunt but its more like targeting users
558456119081828393,UserTaken,general,41,and it isnt targetted at specific players
558456157199663129,Ninobf,general,37,1c applies to chat_ discord and stuff
558456191483772928,Ninobf,general,22,Correct me if im wrong
558456194881290242,sws,general,81,I see the free theo supporters threatening people and targeting them all the time
558456235939069983,UserTaken,general,37,nah_ you can harass with actions nino
558456348866641964,Ninobf,general,64,I think it means threatening to kill you irl rather than in game
558456954792574997,sws,general,36,Still its pretty close to harassment
558456991924879363,sws,general,53,Since pvp usually comes with insulting and harassment
558457019569274880,Scarecrow,general,32,How did Theo get unbanned again?
558457036795281410,Scarecrow,general,24,Which mod agreed to that
558457104545873920,UserTaken,general,28,it was nsa that unbanned him
558457109126184970,sws,general,68,Such as theo saying "get f*cked"_ telling people to "stfu" et cetera
558457154152169504,UserTaken,general,4,so ü§∑
558457164151128088,Scarecrow,general,69,he camps by the Nether highway and kills people just trying to get by
558457185609318402,sws,general,69,It was NSA and his lack of sense of what people want the server to be
558457295135309824,UserTaken,general,0,
558457300772323331,UserTaken,general,5,hmmmm
558457302513090560,sws,general,41,He just doesnt seem to care for democracy
558457355994529793,Scarecrow,general,69,When Theo killed me_ I had my mouse right abovethe ‚Äúdelete Minecraft‚Äù
558457379578970153,sws,general,39,Sorry im just shit at explaining things
558457387120328724,Scarecrow,general,30,Took me ages to get that Sword
558457461678538754,sws,general,62,I know man. Ive lost so much shit to being harassed in the Hub
558457516581847046,sws,general,40,Ive had 3 people on me at once sometimes
558457562215874573,sws,general,43,Its like theyre specifically going after me
558457614204141578,sws,general,57,Technically against the rules but NSA doesnt seem to care
558457815577133057,Bantsy,general,22,Honestly fuck the mods
558458069907013632,sws,general,43,Some are good but its NSA thats the problem
558458128455434241,sws,general,43,He just doesnt seem to care about democracy
558458346391339028,sws,general,114,Connor is a good example of a moderator_ he goes in depth with his bans/punishments and does them for good reasons
558458395225489408,sws,general,60,NSA just isnt really there and isnt keen on what people want
558458415190507520,UserTaken,general,85,I mean_ if you dont like how NSA runs **HIS** server_ you could just go make your own
558458571688378368,sws,general,125,Considering that lots of people donated i would say the people do have a right to controlling the server at least in some way
558458615254745124,UserTaken,general,10,not at all
558458691662249984,UserTaken,general,73,donations are to get extra things on the server and to support its upkeep
558458723362668565,UserTaken,general,31,not to get a say in how its ran
558458833823989771,Pysh,general,65,on a lighter note_ would a 1050ti be able to run slidurs shaders?
558458845169451028,sws,general,48,Really everyone should have a say in how its ran
558458899418578964,sws,general,49,Its democracy and thats how you get a good server
558458994692456479,sws,general,128,If the mods listen and participate in the community and change the server hoe the community wants_ its going to be a good server
558459074073853952,Frost,reports,25,just noticed this as well
558459349618655266,certified narcissist,general,20,whats wrong with NSA
558459351698767902,certified narcissist,general,14,what did he do
558459366626426881,sws,general,73,Right now its still good but it needs a lot of work to how pvp is handled
558459371151949824,UserTaken,general,8,for sure
558459378899091467,BarackObeezy,general,4,Easy
558459416685445151,BarackObeezy,general,34,I have a 2070 and it‚Äôs pretty okay
558459466178363405,sws,general,76,Its more like what hes not doing. I dont think hes managing the server right
558459520469434372,certified narcissist,general,3,how
558459582188486662,certified narcissist,general,41,how do you think he should be managing it
558459601331421184,UserTaken,general,59,"pretty okay" my guy_ isnt that pretty much top of the line
558459632885039113,Scarecrow,general,42,Still 2 more days of being Banned from TGN
558459958132342784,UserTaken,general,27,apparently like a democracy
558460012121554944,certified narcissist,general,12,the thing is
558460053191917574,certified narcissist,general,80,its not NSA thats participating in the community as much as the other moderators
558460098239004703,Altii,general,111,If you guys have this many issues with a single guy_ maybe you should actually have someone ask a mod about it?
558460145625989120,Altii,general,47,instead of just complaining amongst each other?
558460207823323157,UserTaken,general,20,oh trust me_ we have
558460239825993738,certified narcissist,general,109,im fine with NSA not interacting with the community as much_ as long as he can take feedback and work with it
558460248470585351,UserTaken,general,60,they cant actually do anything until he breaks a rule though
558460295262109697,certified narcissist,general,86,the other moderators are to make sure people arent saying the n word and stealing shit

558466306811232266,UserTaken,general,139,<@272432382169055235> Theo is unbanned now_ so that point doesnt matter_ and the bedbombing ban was because of a rule clarification earlier
558466357704785938,UserTaken,general,46,it wasnt because he was killed from a bed bomb
558466377128607765,TheNoobWar,general,99,why do you believe that anything that has to do with rules or policies includes a democratic vote??
558466404190388234,TheNoobWar,general,39,what community behaves in such a manner
558466408200142848,TheNoobWar,general,4,lmao
558466431424135179,TheNoobWar,general,34,it's not an election for a country
558466459924430878,UserTaken,general,78,it was because the bed bomb was *probably* placed somewhere they shouldnt have
558466487481008142,UserTaken,general,41,and yeah nsa_ i dont understand it either
558466492811968523,TheNoobWar,general,21,<@528391460882743307>

558466582058106911,UserTaken,general,4,nice
558466597837209600,Theogilli,general,17,got banned 5 days
558466620658417666,TheNoobWar,general,108,by participating and playing on this server nowhere have I ever advertised that the users decide on anything
558466654263181312,TheNoobWar,general,32,that's not how any of this works
558466743631347713,Bantsy,general,160,TheNoobWar_ with all my respect_ unbanning Theo was a big ass mistake. He's acting innocent now_ but in a few days all hes going to is fuck everying in the ass.
558466778989330442,TheNoobWar,general,20,then he'll be banned
558466781275095040,Bantsy,general,24,Just like he did before.
558466782835245056,TheNoobWar,general,6,simple
558466803794182154,Bantsy,general,19,But he'll appeal...
558466813583687692,Bantsy,general,16,And get unbanned
558466818553937952,TheNoobWar,general,19,then it gets denied
558466819657302026,Theogilli,general,2,no
558466827676680203,Theogilli,general,6,i wont
558466829681426432,sws,general,102,Tldr_ you dont like the new players in the server and would rather just let the new players get camped
558466854465830922,Bantsy,general,44,Why the fuck was it accepted the first time?
558466864251142154,Bantsy,general,27,After all the rule breaking
558466871746363392,Bantsy,general,7,No bans
558466885964922891,Bantsy,general,24,Then the one ban he gets
558466893430652929,UserTaken,general,27,wow thats a big stretch sws
558466898505891854,Bantsy,general,16,It gets appealed
558466905694928923,TheNoobWar,general,43,because we have rules and policies in place
558466935784996870,Bantsy,general,27,By allowing a rule breaker?
558466958551416834,TheNoobWar,general,95,and that there's more to everything than you know than just simply being a player on our server
558467028491698186,Bantsy,general,42,You guys also need to install anticheat...
558467050847076354,TheNoobWar,general,44,his initial ban was for griefing/entity kill
558467094140944394,TheNoobWar,general,18,the kill was valid
558467099912175626,Bantsy,general,41,He should've been banned for other stuff.
558467110926549032,soren,miscellaneous,19,zero k_ yay or nay?
558467122854887424,Bantsy,general,28,All the other rules he broek
558467163841888276,TheNoobWar,general,39,then if he breaks rules he'll be banned
558467164437348354,PortalMaster555,general,69,oh hey is it time for the great Mods Bad of March 21_ 2019 20:28 CDT?
558467170502443009,TheNoobWar,general,14,simple as that

558467357396172801,Bantsy,general,41,You're a bad mod_ thats true information.
558467389990371358,TheNoobWar,general,91,if we bend the procedures in place just because some parts of the community dislikes a user
558467403223138333,Bantsy,general,62,Your server is full of corrupt people_ thats true information.
558467498702536704,UserTaken,general,1,ü§î
558467500128600064,TheNoobWar,general,110,then that sets a dirty precedent for bans to occur to anyone like you even though it doesn't violate the rules

558809901489717278,Iranian Dictator Al-Adeen,general,1568,CHAPTER 1: This is a story about a young boy called OverFast. OverFast liked to play Minecraft on the internet with old men. One day OverFast applied to be a moderator on a minecraft server. He did this to impress a girl who had asked him to prom. He went into school the next day and said over lunch_ ‚ÄúHey Emily‚Äù (that was the name of the girl)_ ‚ÄúGuess what? I‚Äôm a moderator now‚Äù. Emily‚Äôs jaw dropped. ‚ÄúA‚Ä¶. a moderator? Of what?‚Äù OverFast replied confidently ‚ÄúA Minecraft Server with over 100 active members of course‚Äù ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶. Wow. Wow.‚Äù Emily said_ her heart racing ‚ÄúI know I said I would wait until marriage but this‚Ä¶ this is big news. Did I ever tell you how attractive you are_ OverFast?‚Äù ‚ÄúWait what?‚Äù Came a voice from the table behind them. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a mod on a server with over 100 active players?‚ÄùThis was the voice of Kaitlyn Johnson_ the most popular cheerleader in school. Every boy was head over heels in love with her_ she had blonde hair and always wore very short skirts. ‚ÄúI sure am‚Äù_ OverFast replied_ his chest pushed outwards with pride. ‚ÄúI am able to do roll backs and look into people‚Äôs inventorys‚Äù ‚ÄúJesus Christ. Meet me in the art classroom in five minutes‚Äù Now while OverFast had only had limited success with the opposite sex before_ he wasn‚Äôt at all surprised about all the new attention he was getting. Emily held his hand all the way to the art classroom. There was no way she was going to miss out on an opportunity like this. How many girls get to go out with a moderator_ let alone date one? She couldn‚Äôt let Kaitlyn Johnson steal him away..
558809907638435841,Pencyl,general,37,I was reading this in geography class
558809938533810216,Boppolopian,general,13,miguel is god
558809949669425173,Iranian Dictator Al-Adeen,general,1564,CHAPTER 2: Emily held her breath as OverFast opened the door to the art classroom. Inside was Kaitlyn Johnson with a disgusted look on her face. ‚ÄúBack off bitch_ this moderator is mine‚Äù she snarled at Emily ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a gold digger Kaitlyn‚Äù Emily replied_ ‚ÄúI liked him even before he was a tier three donator. You‚Äôre sooo shallow‚Äù OverFast retorted wittily ‚ÄúCalm down girls_ I can just date both of you at the same time‚Äù To be continued..NLNLCHAPTER 3: The next couple of days were a blur. Countless girls were giving OverFast their snaps_ he had to use his super quick moderator typing skills to keep up with it all. Countless picture after picture flooding his dms_ OverFast was spending hours each day going through all of them. The next week_ OverFast was walking down the hall towards his locker_ high-fiving every guy that passed him and winking at all the girls. He started putting his book back into his locker when he heard a shout come from behind him. ‚ÄúHey_ hey OverFast! Is this allowed?‚Äù The voice belonged a young freshman called Theo. Ever since OverFast became a mod Theo had been spending a lot of time with OverFast. ‚ÄúWell technically Theo you‚Äôre not allowed to run in the halls_ but you won‚Äôt get expelled for it‚Äù ‚ÄúOh okay. Hey OverFast! Hey OverFast! Can you hear me? Can I go chat to Will in this classroom?‚Äù ‚ÄúTheo_ that door is locked‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah_ but I know a way in ‚Äì if I hit this kid I‚Äôll be able to force my way in_ it‚Äôs really cool‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that _ don‚Äôt do that that‚Äôs expellable‚Äù ‚ÄúFine‚Äù Theo sighed as he turned away towards the cafeteria
558810053541625858,Iranian Dictator Al-Adeen,general,1105,OverFast was just about to turn away to go have lunch with Emily_ when he saw a neatly folded piece of paper in his locker that he didn‚Äôt recognise. In small handwriting it read ‚ÄúHey_ you probably don‚Äôt know me_ I probably don‚Äôt exist for you but I think you‚Äôre really cool‚Äù OverFast had never seen a message like this before_ Sure_ in the last week his newfound status as a moderator had persuaded a lot of girls to send him pictures_ but a hand written note? That was new‚Ä¶ There was a tug on OverFast‚Äôs shirt sleeve. A girl was standing there. She waved_ pointed at herself and then ran away down the corridor_ without having said a word. ‚ÄúHey OverFast. Who was that?‚Äù Emily said_ having just turned the corner towards OverFast‚Äôs locker. Emily was wearing short shorts and had a very tight crop top on. She was definitely looking for OverFast's attention. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Äù OverFast replied_ staring down the corrido the girl had run away down. ‚ÄúAnyway_ it‚Äôs time we had lunch together. I have something I want to show you. In private.‚Äù Emily grabbed OverFast‚Äôs hand and marched him towards the cafeteria.
558810106117226518,Iranian Dictator Al-Adeen,general,1602,CHAPTER 4: Emily was sat opposite OverFast in the cafeteria_ intensely looking into his eyes as he ate his egg sandwich. ‚ÄúWhat do you want Emily?‚Äù OverFast asked her_ tearing his eyes away from the girl that put the note into his locker.He was wondering if he should have gone over and said hello as she was sat all alone_ not talking to anyone. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to ask what I was wanted to tell you?‚Äù Emily replied slyly_ twirling her hair. ‚ÄúOkay fine_ what were you going to tell me?‚Äù Emily burst out laughing ‚ÄúOh OverFast you‚Äôre so funny. Have I ever told you that? I‚Äôm sure I have. Oh have you been working lately? You‚Äôre the strongest man I know under five foot seven. Anyway_ I wanted to ask if you‚Äôd ever thought about having kids before. Look I‚Äôm going to say something and I want to hear what you have to say about it. We should have kids as soon as possible. Look_ I‚Äôm a virgin_ you‚Äôre almost definitely a virgin but ever since you became a moderator on that minecraft server‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know everything feels different. If you want to..‚Äù ‚ÄúHey everyone! There‚Äôs a fight going on outside!‚Äù Emily‚Äôs proposal was cut short as the whole of the school piled out of the cafeteria to catch a glimpse of the brawl going on outside. ‚ÄúWhatcha going to do headass? Huh? You gonna try and run away?‚Äù Just outside the parking lot a circle had formed around a 6‚Äô4 beast of boy annihilating a tiny freshman. ‚ÄúPlease leave me alone‚Äù the boy cried ‚ÄúI just joined this school‚Äù ‚ÄúI was tryna get to class and you got in my way. So I took my space back_ that‚Äôs how capitalism works‚Äù the hulking boy snarled.(edited)
558810131505086484,Iranian Dictator Al-Adeen,general,577,‚ÄúBREAK THIS UP NOW‚Äù Heads turned as an aged man with wispy tufts of white hair and a walking stick tottered towards the circle. This man was the principal_ known to the students as NSA (a name he earnt for his inescapable watch over the school). ‚ÄúThis is a violence free zone" NSA said calmy_ "o8f_ get off of him NOW. Follow me to my office.‚Äù ‚ÄúWow_ OverFast_ we wouldn‚Äôt let our kid get away with this right?‚Äù Emily asked_ turning to OverFast. No reply came. OverFast had already left the parking lot_ walking quickly back to the cafeteria_ and more importantly the note girl.

558819828396326944,FryingDory,reports,715,The player dixonjazz lured me with a shulker box trade. He offered to trade one shulker box for diamonds. I followed him to his store in the nether hub and he placed a bed_ costing me a totem. This breaks this rule: (c. Scamming other players with in-game deals or services is strictly forbidden. Do not make transactions you cannot actually fulfill your part of the deal in.) as dixon could never fullfill his part in the trade. Someone else_ presumably helping him_ then bombed me a second time which breaks the following rule: (f. Players intentionally aiding others in breaking the rules will be equally punished for the actions of the people they are aiding.) If possible_ I would like the two totems used back

560637536503070775,Nuuble,general,20,he's a funny guy imo
560637550902116362,BarackObeezy,general,28,Constantly seeks out trouble
560637592639635469,Nuuble,general,42,also you kinda took his city away from him
560637618858229790,Nuuble,general,33,so his reaction is understandable
560637657697353731,Nuuble,general,48,plus you overpower him in every aspect as of now
560637671215726624,BarackObeezy,general,33,His city was like 100 blocks away
560637726530076695,BarackObeezy,general,37,We don't want anything to do with him
560637755030503425,Nuuble,general,29,nah it was a bit further down
560637805189922826,Nuuble,general,40,but he built a wall to seperate you guys
560637878414344221,rcfan34,general,29,lets not argue africatown now
560637878942826506,BarackObeezy,general,94,The whole point of the conflict that I wasn't even a part of was to deal with a border dispute
560637895871037450,rcfan34,general,4,yeah
560637913474269186,rcfan34,general,23,but you also said thjat
560637941911781377,BarackObeezy,general,74,And then he founded Phu Bai and I don't understand why he still wants beef
560637944558518283,rcfan34,general,33,the area I used was the tree farm
560637953425014804,BarackObeezy,general,9,Kinda gay
560637986237186048,rcfan34,general,41,but there was no sign claiming it as such
560637996022628352,rcfan34,general,2,so
560638021599363112,BarackObeezy,general,31,I didn't say shit_ for starters

560638213560074270,rcfan34,general,58,yeah it wasn't directed at you it was directed at hobbiton
560638227388694548,rcfan34,general,14,whoa calm down
560638325720088576,BarackObeezy,general,125,I personally don't give a flying fuck about what you do unless it directly affects me or the other shit that's relevant to me
560638394766721065,BarackObeezy,general,34,Such as screaming about africatown
560638450412421120,BarackObeezy,general,56,You control Phu Bai_ you got what you wanted_ ultimately
560638492598861834,rcfan34,general,34,which was me reclaiming africatown
560638511091548187,rcfan34,general,11,which I did
560638538316513292,BarackObeezy,general,4,Good
560638554485686292,BarackObeezy,general,20,I don't fucking care
560638568381415451,rcfan34,general,2,ok
560638589525033002,rcfan34,general,24,im not saying you should
560638606155317248,BarackObeezy,general,33,Ancompton controls that territory
560638641702174731,rcfan34,general,24,I control that territory
560638665035087873,BarackObeezy,general,54,Unless you're using Ancompton to further your own gain
560638695917486092,rcfan34,general,34,ancompton and I were always allied
560638712757616641,BarackObeezy,general,50,Someone told me it was Ancompton who controlled it
560638717136732163,rcfan34,general,16,since africatown
560638732949258240,BarackObeezy,general,27,Oh so ancompton controls it
560638734425653248,rcfan34,general,18,well they're wrong
560638755967598594,BarackObeezy,general,25,Unless you lead ancompton
560638768298852352,rcfan34,general,6,I dont
560638786208399361,rcfan34,general,22,I didn't ever say that
560638824368308234,BarackObeezy,general,39,Then the territory belongs to ancompton
560638853401280523,rcfan34,general,12,no it doesnt
560638857905963028,BarackObeezy,general,39,And its up to them what they do with it
560638870539206674,rcfan34,general,13,who said that
560638938776338432,rcfan34,general,21,because they're wrong
560638953859055619,rcfan34,general,20,ancompton helped out
560638978488008715,BarackObeezy,general,90,Well if ancompton is helping you_ and you've reclaimed AT wit htheir help_ then its theirs
560639003477409823,BarackObeezy,general,27,Unles they handed it to you
560639014554697748,BarackObeezy,general,15,Which is likely
560639020476923965,rcfan34,general,24,thats not logical at all
560639046213173285,rcfan34,general,23,I built the thing there
560639074118008852,rcfan34,general,38,abd so they came and built more thinfs
560639087694970881,BarackObeezy,general,22,So then you control it
560639101326327814,rcfan34,general,4,yeah
560639117122207755,rcfan34,general,13,but they help
560639139494494231,rcfan34,general,29,is that so hard to understand
560639230347313162,BarackObeezy,general,94,Bottom line is I don't care unless you provoke hobbiton. We don't want anything to do with you
560639286098132993,rcfan34,general,4,good
560639296810385409,BarackObeezy,general,50,And you probably don't want anything to do with us
560639395632381977,BarackObeezy,general,25,So let's keep it that way
560640155678015508,rcfan34,general,130,also <@!198106540924731403> im reading up and I see "repetitive and annoying harassment of hobbiton" so what would that be exactly
560640260552392704,BarackObeezy,general,77,Signs and then having firestorm try to get people to jump hobbiton residentsa
560640336549117973,BarackObeezy,general,58,Unless you and firestorm have nothing to do with eachother
560640554543611906,mo,trading,24,buying feathers and eggs

560640832936607764,BarackObeezy,general,59,Thought it came up in hobbiton discord but I could be wrong
560640924036759558,BarackObeezy,general,73,Doesn't matter_ just stop placing signs down saying shit about africatown
