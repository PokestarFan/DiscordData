558819828396326944,FryingDory,715,The player dixonjazz lured me with a shulker box trade. He offered to trade one shulker box for diamonds. I followed him to his store in the nether hub and he placed a bed_ costing me a totem. This breaks this rule: (c. Scamming other players with in-game deals or services is strictly forbidden. Do not make transactions you cannot actually fulfill your part of the deal in.) as dixon could never fullfill his part in the trade. Someone else_ presumably helping him_ then bombed me a second time which breaks the following rule: (f. Players intentionally aiding others in breaking the rules will be equally punished for the actions of the people they are aiding.) If possible_ I would like the two totems used back

560631534449590272,UserTaken,176,Lord_farquaad has spammed multiple things in chat_ along with potentially bedbombing in the protected nether hub. I cant confirm if the bombs were in the protected part though.

560633192902819861,AlfredoBilly,54,I was illegal bed bombed by farquaad in the nether hub
560633811122126855,AlfredoBilly,320,it was around 2 minutes ago and I rage quit so I don't have screenshots but a lot of people were on and he's been doing a lot of bannable stuff. Other people died too and if you check messages you'll see he spammed for me to come over to him across the nether hub before the incident happened. Thank you_ I've gtg though
560634062461730846,UserTaken,105,can confirm farquaad is hacking. just sped through the nether hub. It was absolutely not a result of lag.

560982226280644623,Aethelwulf987,38,Would shooting flaming arrows be okay?
560984317636116497,thexman,110,<@318637920707936257> currently no traps of any kind_ player triggered or automatic_ are allowed on the server
560984552898560089,Aethelwulf987,23,Alright_ I took it down
560985093196349451,Aethelwulf987,111,Thatâ€™s a stupid rule though_ how else are players without god sets supposed to defend against players with them
560985385744728086,thexman,104,There is a promising set of rules in the making right now that includes changes to the player trap rules
560985772568608784,Aethelwulf987,89,Thatâ€™s good to hear_ at the moment towns like Africa and phubai are basically defenseless
