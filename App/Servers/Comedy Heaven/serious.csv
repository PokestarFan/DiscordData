560632548560994312,High Ping Cowboy,101,And I'd say it's not offensive because it doesn't feature any slights towards gay and/or trans people

560637394538201099,RaccoonEggs,26,I feel so constantly tired
560637468760735771,RaccoonEggs,76,I almost don‚Äôt feel like a person sometimes_ just a conscious waste of space
560645407366053898,The Rules,86,That‚Äôs your dehydrated and exhausted lizard brain telling you to take care of yourself
560645488681156611,The Rules,64,Proper sleep_ exercise_ and nutrition are all good mood boosters
560645686383738902,The Rules,21,Not to mention energy

560977407457230858,Vic Rattlehead,141,has anyone ever argued with someone and the person you're arguing with acts like it's because you're arguing about it with them in particular
560977521286447114,Vic Rattlehead,83,because honestly_ it's one of the most annoying fucking things i've ever dealt with
560977599258558485,RaccoonEggs,16,what do you mean
560977679956967459,Vic Rattlehead,53,basically_ i moderate another server with another guy
560977686647013387,RaccoonEggs,83,when your arguing about it with that specific person and they think it‚Äôs about them
560977713523851294,Vic Rattlehead,20,let's call him...bob
560977896076869636,Vic Rattlehead,111,Now_ every time we argue_ Bob always pulls the "you're arguing with me because the point I made comes from me".
560978887731838984,RaccoonEggs,16,Are you head mod
560978917565923361,Vic Rattlehead,9,In a way.
560978948314628097,Vic Rattlehead,19,I'm the oldest one.
560978984951873566,Vic Rattlehead,36,And the longest friend of the owner.
560979036029845505,RaccoonEggs,39,The idea of discord drama is cringe imo
560979078858145815,Vic Rattlehead,16,It is_ honestly.
560979122025922580,RaccoonEggs,44,How tf are you arguing? What is he mad about
560979211326717972,Vic Rattlehead,50,Like I said_ he thinks I'm after him or something.
560979362896281661,Vic Rattlehead,101,He's had people complain he's a useless mod (despite the fact that he's not_ verifiably) in the past.
560979418923794461,RaccoonEggs,11,what server
560979420517498890,Vic Rattlehead,55,I probably said something like that *once*_ months ago.
560979455548325900,Vic Rattlehead,29,I'd like to keep that secret.
560979590831538187,Vic Rattlehead,61,Don't want to give any unneeded attention to the "situation".
560979713754136617,RaccoonEggs,57,Have you tried just not responding when he acts like that
560979762986745856,Vic Rattlehead,15,I did actually.
560979801771606016,Vic Rattlehead,43,That was when he pulled the "bad day" card.
560979818741760033,RaccoonEggs,3,hmm
560979896185258000,RaccoonEggs,43,sounds like someone venting on the internet
560980231637303296,Vic Rattlehead,203,I have no idea in that case. Dude has claimed to be depressed_ bad parents_ is a bit of a shrinking violet (he does sound like he wants to die and he's insanely quiet_ so 1 and 3 *may* be right)_ but idk
560980326034440212,Vic Rattlehead,57,When he's not being paranoid_ he's generally an okay guy.
560980402626363411,Vic Rattlehead,70,Except when he randomly doesn't talk in the middle of conversations...
560980448101138437,Vic Rattlehead,25,but that's another thing.
560980450496217088,RaccoonEggs,18,Is this text or vc
560980496901865511,Vic Rattlehead,6,Voice.
