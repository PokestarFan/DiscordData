558444067168583680,borrow69,77,Would fire rate perk decrease the time it takes to charge the noble launcher?
558444187599765516,DiabeticDOTexe,47,Fire rate doesn't change the charge rate_ iirc.
558444189801512961,Aurora,71,i heard that it doesnt - i dont have it though so havent checked myself
558445748924973076,Zeayox,61,Increased building health or Building Healing? Why? On traps.
558445856756465684,Zeayox,49,I assume healing_ but any good arguments against?
558445904118546432,NHgi,23,healing is good for edb
558445993868394536,NHgi,68,building health is good if you try to get wall with a lot of life xD
558446099317260290,Traaash Knight ⚡ 130,53,healing better to stack healing and heal stuff faster
558446590876975116,C0BYK,33,what do i get with legendary flux
558447005609885696,Aurora,32,mercury lmg - bulletstorm jonesy
558447073804943366,sws,62,<@556632636295217162> Mercury lmg_ neon sniper_ helium shotgun
558447095502077982,Aurora,56,the lmg is one of the best weapons in the game currently
558447182236090398,C0BYK,19,what makes it good?
558447235294167042,NHgi,45,<@556632636295217162>  explosiono every 5 hit
558447329221410816,NHgi,74,is really really op .... most of the dmg from bundlebuss come from that xD
558448621255786506,Aurora,164,Also it is an LMG - and we have Crackshot who can stack his passive to 145%/50% and Bulletstorm Jonesy who can do 50%+30%Fire rate / 25% that stacks per shot you do
558448671814057995,Aurora,53,so the bigger magazine guns are really good currently
558449013481799714,Aurora,50,only downside is it costs 1 bacon per 100 shots :x
558450416887529474,Nưt,76,unless you're stacked on energy ammo because you never used it before this 😎
558450845998514187,TheOne-Rebeard,58,anyone here having an issue on research not able to reset?
558451392625246210,Velocity,92,how worth are the 50 buck llamas when theyre gold and how many gold ones can i get in a row?
558451560267382785,Dead_Man,3,RNG
558451601371562004,Dead_Man,29,and only worth what is inside
558451694917255168,DiabeticDOTexe,163,<@371471943947386881> It is all RNG. It is up to you to decide what is worth it based on if you need something inside the llama_ or if there is something you want.
558451714638872586,2U,68,They are worth if they got a legendary/mythic survivor in my opinion
558451733760835604,BlueKazoo,42,the people in save the world chat are mean
558451747434004480,Velocity,90,2 legendary survivors which ill use_ a legendary sniper and a legendary survivalist jonesy
558451777901559819,Dead_Man,29,or a weapon you havent gotten
558451801205243915,Dead_Man,34,worth the survs if they are needed
558451977424470016,DiabeticDOTexe,102,I like to get llamas personally_ if they are a jackpot_ or if they have something I have been wanting.
558452041391931436,Velocity,81,also what about the 700 gold for a legendary survivor if i need them? yay or nay?
558452176171565077,Dead_Man,3,yay
558452190205706242,Dead_Man,10,always yay
558452198355501067,DiabeticDOTexe,50,I'd buy those. It is rng for what the survivor is.
558453574149996595,Aurora,143,For gold everything in the shop is Yay - it just goes down a priority list and how much oyu manage depends on how much of a life you have (lol)
558454423173464085,Velocity,62,got the llama and survivor. got almost 2 power levels from it.
558460211283623936,Sashä,63,Are transform key thingies worth using at my level in mid plank
558460578683682827,Aurora,77,everything thats below rare should be transformed into rare and then recycled
558460878014513163,Aurora,145,if you bought the training manuals in the store you should have a lot of those so i would transform into weapon and/or traps to get those manuals
558461536029376513,Teddybear,152,The mission for 100vbucks saying complete 8 ssd can that be completed by doing other people's ssd? Instead of your own? @ me if you have a answer for me
558461850732462089,Yadi,43,Yes it can be completed by doing other ones
558462462614306839,Sleepless,24,best dragon slash build?
558464406350987281,Sleepless,113,For a dragon slash build_ who would be more beneficial as a commander_ Dragon Scorch or  Snuggle Specialist Sarah
558466106197672066,Aurora,120,Personally i would prefer Sarah as i tend to use my slash in a more strategic way for the burn to do as much as possible
558466205271195658,RubMyTwinky,32,obsidian or ss for sir lancelot?
558466235935752204,Aurora,97,But at the same time Scorch has a wider range so maybe the tail wouldnt be as needed if i was him
558466334589976587,Aurora,40,i hear obsidian for the attack speed atm
558468282366033962,MRsecret746,116,that moment when u play quad atlas and get 3 floating atlas <:kylethink:504286093563265064> <:gg:469114977148731413>
558472202882777091,RubMyTwinky,31,sir lancelot or spectral blade?
558472692098007050,JiraHwang,18,Obsidian for melee
558472758560948255,JiraHwang,31,<@418920049248829440> both good
558472920025006080,Don,80,Can someone tell me the base crit chance of Sir Lancelot Without any perks to it
558472930489663498,Traven™,44,Is a head hunter good for a Mercury lmg load
558473181531340814,Nưt,79,try to get bullet storm jonsey or crackshot (those are the best for lmg builds)
558473232467099658,JiraHwang,28,<@506596038057000970> is 25%
558473242243760138,Nưt,45,<@!506596038057000970> 25% if im not mistaken
558473664291405824,Don,8,Thanks 😃
558754973454958592,Williamcjj,18,145% DMG or 225 CD
558755036692348939,NHgi,53,<@354013247831146507>  no _ sledgehammer still bugged
558755044468719641,Williamcjj,58,Also its not 145_ its like 145 for the last 50-75ish shots
558755056577413125,Aurora,58,Crackshot does more damage on your crits than sledgehammer
558755080279425043,TwinePlayz,43,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4JyFUTMMX8
558755123921420310,Williamcjj,57,i dont think its bugged tho? I do massive damage with TAS
558755131525693451,Aurora,29,you need 50 shots to get 145%
558755172248059914,Aurora,51,and sledge is only visual - you stilöl get the 225%
558755184810000415,NHgi,31,50 shot with a LMG i nothing xD
558755315974275072,Williamcjj,39,Its still a downside u have to consider
558755329517682729,Aurora,155,you have 200+ shots - so its 150 shots at 145% - and since you have the Mercury - the explosions scale waaay better with crackshot than with Sledge anyways
558755352221581333,Aurora,35,not when you use an LMG its not atm
558755373159415831,Williamcjj,84,u cant just take the best of the build_ round up everything_ and ignore the downside
558755424027934737,NHgi,16,which downside ?
558755445007712256,Williamcjj,31,It is a downside_ not a big one
558755453614424068,NHgi,24,the recoil is nothing xD
558755530538090520,Williamcjj,37,first 50 shot doing slightly less dmg
558755541661515796,Aurora,150,because there barely is a downside at all - Bulletstorm Jonesy for example outscales Sledgehammer after 17 shots for example (according to whitesushi)
558755618995961877,Aurora,66,no - only like your first 25-30 do less - after that they do more.
558755650663088130,NHgi,38,yea but 50 shot with an lmg is nothing
558755655603716116,Aurora,26,and you use an LMG at 200+
558755701632270347,Williamcjj,35,yeah ur right those are good points
558755721580380171,Williamcjj,19,might consider that
558755807148244992,Williamcjj,71,Also ammo recovery is also a really good offensive perk with crack shot
558755847035944981,Aurora,138,is it a downside with weaker first shots? sure_ but Sledges weak side is that he has like 170 shots being weaker compared to crackshots 30
558755855550513155,Williamcjj,37,that very creative i never thought of
558755995380219924,Aurora,87,for standard ARs you can pick pretty much any of the 3 - Crackshot/Sledge/Bullet Jonesy
558756093304504320,Williamcjj,9,i have 1q
558756228356898856,Williamcjj,90,which is better_ LMG energy or element matching regular ARs_ like wraith or pain train etc
558756422154715139,NHgi,71,hmm for mist monster _ LMG mercury with crankshot still the best so far
558756485643894816,Williamcjj,25,mist i wud use bundlebuss
558756495580332042,Michael,144,Quick question.... If I had to choose between 2 Dragon Slash support heroes... which would you choose? Dragon Slash or Snuggle Specialist Sarah?
558756522591780874,Williamcjj,4,ohko
558756555453890586,Williamcjj,6,dragon
558756592250650624,NHgi,83,<@354013247831146507>  LMG mercury have more dps than the bundlebuss with crankshot
558756597237547048,Williamcjj,42,snuggle is good but not better than dslash
558756651402788881,Williamcjj,3,wow
558756676803493909,NHgi,65,but bundlebuss don't need to have a specifique loadout to be good
558756678661570563,Williamcjj,26,if thats true thats insane
558756715764383754,Williamcjj,4,yeah
558756798824185876,Michael,138,Alright cool... that's what I thought but someone was pretty convincing with their snuggle specialist so I have both at 130 now anyways :S
558756815626829835,Williamcjj,59,but whats better_ element specific regular AR or energy LMG
558756912452206595,Aurora,23,Mercurys explosions tbh
558756938918133761,Williamcjj,5,fosho
558756961672364042,Williamcjj,16,5 hit explosion?
558756972854509606,Williamcjj,9,thats hot
558757002675879936,NHgi,40,the explosion is the big part of the dmg
558757056723550208,Aurora,89,yeah - thats why the gun is stronger than most everythign else - same with the bundlebuss
558757083525152779,Williamcjj,22,yeah im gonna try that
558757243412021280,Williamcjj,20,thx for educating me
558757267546046485,Williamcjj,30,Learned hella new things today
558757354108223499,Williamcjj,68,always gotta consider whether the support is stronger as a commander
558757688029478928,Doggoice,36,how to get missions in spring event?
558757974718545941,Aurora,109,there arent any missions on the event map currently - well theres one or 2 that takes you there but thats all
558758025528213513,Aurora,65,the missions themselves are done in regular stages in any PL zone
558758040136974336,Genesis,29,Read pinned messages here....
558758106704773122,Genesis,30,Point 2 of dave pinned comment
558758125113442326,Williamcjj,79,so does the ammo recovery return the bullet to the magazine or just in ur pool?
558758279187005441,NHgi,39,<@354013247831146507>  u don't use ammp
558758350041645080,Williamcjj,4,Nice
558758370824159242,Williamcjj,14,Yeah thats hot
558758478013923328,Aurora,57,which means that 200 mag size hits 248 - depending on rng
558758531331915796,Williamcjj,2,ya
558758572675170323,NHgi,111,yep 😄 so when u use him in main you have 48% .... you have max 3k energy ammo _ is like you have  4440 max ammo
558758703088533504,Williamcjj,22,nah no way i main that
558758862891515905,NHgi,97,x) i use him in main when i need to do mission with soldier and i don't want to waste all my ammo
558759175254179861,Williamcjj,42,have u guys looked at ambush buzz support?
558759197840506884,Williamcjj,18,underrated as fuck
558762957706887181,Bully Hunter 77,49,Yeah it was one of Field Agent Rio's old passives
558763003713945610,Bully Hunter 77,72,Super good for hit and run crown control <:justright:327528247900372994>
558763220408729600,Bloodless,103,Today I used patrol ward trap but it didn't prevent spawning in the spots. What's the use of this ****.
558763374473641993,DivisionZer0,64,It doesn't prevent spawns in missions. It thwarts patrol spawns.
558763440907223060,Williamcjj,61,<@240671089544527873> i mean more like combine with gunblazer
558763575829725194,Williamcjj,26,for a permanent 105% boost
558763653525012481,Bloodless,36,<@188718399180898305> didn't get It!
558763965682024451,o.c.rookie2000,88,When u have 2.6 million survivor xp ur survivors are maxed out n u need 3 mythic leads 😞
558764849858084905,Bloodless,171,<@501153835738333184> u can max out other survivors for different combination boosts. In frostnite you needed trap durability but in regular missions ability damage. IMHO.
558764963477454850,silence_tilldeath,47,why do we have to wait 6 hours for something :/

558766009394266149,o.c.rookie2000,68,Ditto. Gotta get to 131. In the meantime_ finish rolling up my traps
558766702234566743,Bloodless,109,Same. But I don't know it's wise to max out all traps with legendary perks. I don't even use the 2/3 of them.
558767874894856224,o.c.rookie2000,122,I’m talking only about the ones I use—-gas_ walk and floor launchers_ dynamos_  spikes_ wall darts ceiling electric fields

558799817002844170,DiabeticDOTexe,169,Just cause you start a mission manually_ doesn't mean you are by yourself. People can join you or people don't. It all depends on if people are playing that mission too.
558799968140263426,DiabeticDOTexe,93,If you party isn't set to public_ then no one can join you. You might wanna set it to public.

558805329958141955,Alex,102,When I phase shift it causes anti material charge to cost zero energy_ instead of the listed 20% less.
558805444987191296,Alex,31,Wait_ nvm. It is for each hero.
558805476465442846,Alex,25,Thought was just 20%. lol

558805573907382292,DiabeticDOTexe,53,Yeah_ as a heads up_ a lot of them say for each hero.
558805637971312651,Alex,73,Was it always for each hero though? I don't recall it being one of those.
558805836542115851,Alex,56,Would "Heavy Attack" count as melee weapon heavy attack?
558805916317777927,DiabeticDOTexe,64,It should be. I doubt they changed the team perk with no notice.
558806181343264778,DiabeticDOTexe,141,Also_ yes to your second question. That is the only heavy attacks there are in this game. Weapons don't have an alt fire mode that I know of.
558806253946798091,Alex,17,The pickaxe does.
558806491096809473,DiabeticDOTexe,31,I don't think that would count.
558806552211882001,Alex,72,Anti Material Charge is pickaxe heavy attack for outlanders and it does.
558806586957496341,DiabeticDOTexe,26,That is an ability though.
558806625415200768,Alex,38,It is the heavy attack of the pickaxew
558806777395675136,DiabeticDOTexe,121,AMC got moved to the heavy attack for the pick axe. There are perks for it_ so I don't know if that in particular counts.
558806890432299009,Alex,106,it is a perk_ not so much an ability.NLIt literally says "activate heavy attack with your pickaxe equipped"
558807052940476416,DiabeticDOTexe,89,There are perks for it_ like base. It used to take up one of your 3 slots for outlanders.
558807061379678268,Genesis,20,Its an ability tho..
558807196847177739,Alex,71,Then why would they call it "Class Perks" instead of "Class Abilities"?
558807249946935298,Alex,27,Confusing wording_ perhaps?
558807448769658892,DiabeticDOTexe,105,Because now every hero specializes on one perk. There are perks for it_ but that does not make it a perk.
558807622908903425,Alex,69,They called them perks though_ not abilities.NLThat is just confusing.
558807697663983631,DiabeticDOTexe,63,They used to be called abilites_ and you boost them with perks.
558807704009703435,Alex,50,I guess you would also call loot llama an ability?
558807803565703168,DiabeticDOTexe,64,Loot llama is just loot llama. It had no name or classification.
558807841260175380,DiabeticDOTexe,31,There were perks for it though.
558808032751124491,Genesis,45,Just FYI pickaxe is considered a melee weapon
558808158957469723,Genesis,14,Its an ability

558808398272135199,DiabeticDOTexe,73,That is strange. Never thought the pickaxe was considered a melee weapon.

558808610021441556,Genesis,78,If u ever get the melee daily go to stonewood and just use pickaxe. You'll see

558808668829646876,Alex,17,After Twine Peaks
558808747309400094,Genesis,85,Also a reason why it kinda makes sense keen eyes will disappear when u switch weapons
558808750119583793,Jack Wilebane,123,<@150050822988890112> you just build it in a specific mission_ think it's in the Spring Event area of the map if i remember

558808848044130315,Genesis,52,If you built it a lever will appear under the basket
558808891396456468,Genesis,38,Just dont get stuck in it if u solo...
558808962791637014,Alex,60,I don't lose keen eyes when I switch from the pickaxe though
558809006433501224,Jack Wilebane,22,what even is keen eyes
558809023122636800,Alex,33,Just the in the zone bonus damage
558809028109533199,Jack Wilebane,32,i don't think i've heard of that
558809030764527616,DiabeticDOTexe,40,That's because keen eyes is glitched rn.
558809037874003989,Alex,14,and movespeed.
558809103464529940,Alex,41,It's been like it since the hero loadout.
558809283060432906,DiabeticDOTexe,139,<@257356780361744394> Keen eyes is something that lets you see glowing objects through walls as an outlander. It is basically a loot radar.
558809333236760576,DiabeticDOTexe,54,And yeah it has_ but it never worked like that before.
558809480674934784,Jack Wilebane,9,oh_ right
558809523050250290,Jack Wilebane,31,that's been working fine for me
558809558529867777,Jack Wilebane,52,unless i'm missing what the glitch is supposed to be
558809592973361172,DiabeticDOTexe,112,It even says in the description for in the zone_ that if you switch weapons_ you are supposed to lose the buffs.
558809621268004884,Alex,49,It doesn't turn off when you switch from pickaxe.
558809659037712399,Jack Wilebane,8,oh_ damn
558809704101576704,DiabeticDOTexe,95,The glitch is that it doesn't go away after switching weapons_ so the seeing loot is permanent.
558809760384679949,Jack Wilebane,5,weird
558809805955792896,Alex,48,makes it a good reason to run outlanders though.
558809869180862486,Alex,47,Seeing loot can be somewhat valuable sometimes.
558809962961174528,DiabeticDOTexe,75,Yeah_ but is will be fixed at some point_ so I wouldn't get too used to it.
558810125901758466,Alex,48,I run constructor more than anything these days.
558810215563395094,Alex,45,That or quite a bit of sledgehammer/calamity.

558828093108912128,Aurora,156,yeah - maybe one of the bot messages arent updated then? - i know i saw 15 minutes somewhere here at least... maybe its one of the other channels... oh well
558828213002829839,Alex,92,I didn't think it was hourly_ but am not sure personally so only got pinned post to go from.
558828414723817507,Aurora,108,pinned post says 1 hour - but if you click on the text at the top in the trade channel it says 15 minutes hm
558828725471543296,Alex,65,That's kinda stupid. They should fix whichever of those is wrong.
558828978031427585,FoxAwoo,47,What’s better_ elegant scythe or reaper scythe?
558829070977073182,Alex,9,Drumroll.
558829079764140032,Alex,1,😄
558829093207146506,FoxAwoo,1,?
558829193991815168,Alex,30,Prob Masamune or Spectral tbh.
558829312430571551,FoxAwoo,54,I know those are good_ I just want to try out a scythe
558829378876866593,Alex,41,Ohh_ no clue. Sorry_ I don't use those :/
558829438553423933,FoxAwoo,9,It’s fine
558830348352618527,Aurora,131,<@!304044033225785345>  according to Whitesushis sheet thingy the Reaper has higher DPS - a little less impact but more crit chance
558830653999677452,Aurora,175,the Neon Scythe has the same DPS as the reaper though - higher attack speed and for some reason only uses 0.4 durability per attack vs the 0.52 ... so it lasts a little longer
558830885382783000,FoxAwoo,29,So the neon scythe is better?
558831008041140260,FoxAwoo,50,Wait does the neon scythe have the same perks btw?
558831050675978240,Aurora,60,has about 1% less dps - and lasts insignificantly longer lol
558831119726805002,Aurora,69,personally id prefer it though as it has slightly higher attack speed
558831447176380426,Aurora,22,that i cant answer atm
558834649254854706,akfas,274,I had a friend say to me when_ we helped someone do SSD10 CV_ that if you hit the wall with trap it will give back materials for traps too_ is that true? Tried to make do that but can't 1 hit any structure because i have done all the SSD.. Or did they remove the 1hit thing?
558834796948619264,Bully Hunter 77,45,<@155684685022887936> they removed it for now
558834910811652096,Nưt,48,due to some soyboys using a du pe glitch with it
558835150633435136,akfas,98,but did it give materials for traps too_ i only remember giving it materials for building only.. ?
558835299732684809,Bully Hunter 77,32,Yes it was like recycling a trap
558835397405179905,Bully Hunter 77,87,It didn't show up on the left side thoughNLThe materials went straight to your inventory
558835541223669771,akfas,50,oh_ really_ Thanks for info. I didn't notice that.
558835877506449409,FoxAwoo,32,Best perks for silenced specter?
558836836500504626,Aurora,29,you can do 2 cd on it right ?
558836926178918402,FoxAwoo,12,I’m not sure
558836951839408158,FoxAwoo,29,I’ll check after this mission
558838086784647187,Aurora,136,Well its either CR CD CD Mag if possible_ or you replace one CD with a Fire Rate - reason being Sledgehammers support or commander skill
558838335427313664,Quasar,16,It can have 2 CD
558838699383717898,Upimppi,30,but fire rate makes it so nice

558840256149979157,FoxAwoo,61,CR CD CD Mag would have more DPS than CR CD Mag FR tho right?
558841006024294411,FoxAwoo,47,Wait silenced specter can only have one CD oops
558841298191253514,FoxAwoo,56,Well you can have two CD but you’d have to remove the CR
558841870109769750,Upimppi,58,i wouldnt think so fire rate alone adds quite a bit of dps

558849273538805770,Upimppi,95,chances of that heppening is kinda super low theres a screen you check over before you click ok

558849701802409995,DiabeticDOTexe,125,The only idea I got is log in through your xbox or ps account_ unlink the email_ like the right email_ and see if that works.

558849904722575390,Upimppi,139,i dont understand if it dont exsist make one with that name if it matching then complete the email if theres one already exsist log into it
558850245224693780,DiabeticDOTexe,117,Look_ either the person is a hacker_ linked and email they don't have access to_ or had no clue what they were doing.

559063501679624201,DiabeticDOTexe,207,Mercury LMG is said to be the one of the highest if not highest DPS in the game. The difference that makes it hard to use is the expensive ammo. You will probably use the Hemlock more often for regular mobs.
