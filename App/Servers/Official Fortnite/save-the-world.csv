560623018296999936,Lucky [⚡131],186,I don’t see any valid proof that backs up people claim of twine story next week or new zone. Rumours started from pl100 rocket launch.. which can just be a place holder to something else
560623088597729301,Dante Ironclaw,13,Next question
560623098001358875,ShibbeBoye,21,its 99% a placeholder
560623127244308480,ShibbeBoye,20,twine rocket mission
560623164804300821,Dante Ironclaw,44,WHY DOES HYBRID HAVE A VOICE AND DIRE DOESNT
560623175252049921,bmg1001,65,The PL 100 Launch the Rocket that's been in the game since Day 1?
560623205568479243,bmg1001,14,Definite proof
560623224824660011,ShibbeBoye,59,even though ps4 and xb1 has a trophy for completing twine 6
560623225365856256,Dysonchips,22,hybrid has a naked ass
560623225965379608,Lucky [⚡131],57,Yeah 100% as In AMA they said currently no new zone plans
560623344739811358,Lucky [⚡131],44,My guess is twine story maybe in 9.0 or 10.0
560623348166557717,ShibbeBoye,73,if i dont get the hammer from opening 11 llamas with the tickets i farmed
560623368148221962,ShibbeBoye,14,i'll be angery
560623382966697984,Dante Ironclaw,41,I like the effect on the dragon slash tho
560623479137894420,Marina Belmont,34,I’m probably gonna flux the hammer
560623519814123541,Midnight,62,Anyone wanna look at my dumbass expensive canny storm shield ?
560623577179750419,Marina Belmont,63,Due to the fact that 1. I’m a lazy bitch_ and 2. My luck is bad
560623617722023941,ShibbeBoye,40,my canny storm shield is mainly t3 stone
560623705978306561,ShibbeBoye,33,but rn im poor on metal and stone
560623718305366019,Marina Belmont,28,Most ssds are Nature anyways
560623760584212480,Dysonchips,90,im not gonna do the blast off mission just so i can know where i was when twine comes back
560623775427592192,ShibbeBoye,42,only 10k metal in storage_ about 15k stone
560623809908965380,ShibbeBoye,14,i need to farm
560623961138921473,Marina Belmont,54,I need to farm gold so I can just buy legendary jonesy
560624011122311169,ShibbeBoye,9,sergeant?
560624079711895562,Marina Belmont,14,The event one.
560624167167459330,ShibbeBoye,68,im farming gold for snuggle specialist for now_ i need a ninja build
560624225652834316,ShibbeBoye,33,and all my outlanders are weak af

560624564133167114,Marina Belmont,53,But yeah I need to expand on my outlanders and ninjas
560624596823441423,Clorox Bleach,78,Uhhh I did storm king and I got 4 caches but it didn’t count the pirate quest🙃
560624697604177925,Clorox Bleach,18,What is epic doing
560624800234733569,Dante Ironclaw,28,Its not those kind of caches
560624842110402563,bmg1001,6,Yeahhh
560624878898642950,Dante Ironclaw,50,Its just a standard 'go to map_ pick up quest obj'
560624895634178068,Clorox Bleach,95,Omg again. They should’ve been more specific just like with the trash can counting as a barrel.
560624985123848202,Blace,18,It's a fetch quest
560624991050137630,Dante Ironclaw,27,Trash cans are common sense
560624997639651348,bmg1001,45,If it's round and can hold stuff_ is *barrel*
560625035400970365,Blace,55,How can you mistake that for caches that give perk ups?
560625039347810325,Dante Ironclaw,39,The caches could have been named better
560625094154649620,Blace,24,It is aptly named though
560625109581299727,Blace,13,Supply caches
560625156737728512,Blace,18,Not perk up caches
560625189201772574,Clorox Bleach,21,It is named caches...
560625245854367754,Blace,40,Again_ how can you confuse a fetch quesr
560625274471841793,! a L1vinDoŔito,13,drum gun best
560625281896022016,bmg1001,112,I won't lie though_ when I first saw the quest_ I thought the same thing_ but then I knew it probably wasn't it.
560625386057367572,Clorox Bleach,93,I thought it was because the tickets were doubled so that probably means it’s a harder quest.
560626034379194388,Clorox Bleach,29,y epic gotta do me like that.
560626606264287232,iwana_dooyu69,43,why do i queued into hispanic games so much

560998073594019850,Poncherello,14,never tried it
560998097556209694,DrCrazy51,14,It’s very good
560998189335969812,Fwuffy™,89,The new scythe has a heavy attack where you can spin for as long as you still have energy
560998196860682261,deliciousCheddar,36,Guys_ I really love the baron hammer
560998235708063745,Fwuffy™,47,and it drains it while you keep the button hold
560998248169603074,ShibbeBoye,5,speed
560998264535646208,ShibbeBoye,16,baron speed boye
560998275206086676,Fwuffy™,23,TL;DR:    "FOR DEMACIA"
560998352968220692,deliciousCheddar,38,Spinning around at the speed of scythe
560998368155926548,Poncherello,116,yeah i haven't used the baron yet_ but i really liked the perks_ so i was thinking make it my energy hammer... maybe
560998387785269278,ShibbeBoye,64,everybody be using the melees but how good is the sniper rifle 🤔
560998435420110875,DrCrazy51,152,Also for how to get caches easily_ if you’re talking about that pirate quest it’s not about going for one of those evolution material caches for example
560998669466337298,DrCrazy51,22,<@!200414341789384704>
560998806494117889,DrCrazy51,71,But more so looking for some object that contains some stuff in the map
560998876224552982,Fwuffy™,90,Alright_ evolved my scythe! Now I just need to wait a month or get 10 CB levels to flux it
560998888937619463,Poncherello,37,first thing i level'd up was the trap
560998890749427713,Fwuffy™,7,....ugh
560998982055362560,Poncherello,73,second was the AR ... and it's great for people that can use semi autos 😉
560999064716443652,DrCrazy51,82,And then there’s me who’s still trying to look for the new scythe with snare on it
560999112946876446,Shwab,84,I think the first trap i ever perked up was broadside .. atleast into epic territory
560999148938199049,Shwab,22,Broadside speaks to me
560999284724465665,Fwuffy™,51,I actually got THREE leg scythes with snare on them
560999301308874754,Fwuffy™,17,it was so...nasty
560999320267259907,Poncherello,48,yeah not very material heavy.. and good coverage
560999807905169419,DrCrazy51,76,<@189856293509398529> if only there was a way to give those schematics to me
560999853317160960,Fwuffy™,18,Would gladly do so
560999956853293076,Fwuffy™,127,but_ if schematic trading was allowed...that would open up a pandora's box of the most vile and evil trading community possible
561000041775497222,Greedy,30,snare best 6th perk for melee🤔
561000050822610954,Fwuffy™,59,BRats ruin everything_ make it so we can't have nice things
561000130602336266,Fwuffy™,53,Best melee perk is 25% shield regen on 5 eliminations
561000191252234249,Shwab,38,and with dim mak passive you never die
561000270469791784,Greedy,49,that perk is useless wym since dim mak is a thing
561000328758034434,Fwuffy™,38,Not every melee build uses only ninjas
561000360416772098,Greedy,4,most
561000362866245649,Fwuffy™,57,if you want a hammer or club build_ you need constructors
561000462715715594,Dante Ironclaw,90,<@189856293509398529> only 2 weeks_ you get 50 flux per week_ costs 100 to increase rarity
561000500317913089,Fwuffy™,8,Ah_ true
561000531091521536,Fwuffy™,40,still_ might be able to get 10 CB levels
