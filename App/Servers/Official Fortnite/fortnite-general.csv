558829437588602911,TEDDY,1195,**__There’s No Such Thing As Free V-Bucks__**NLNLBeware of scam sites offering free or discounted V-Bucks. Free V-bucks sites are **all** scams. No matter how pretty they look. Some are fake webpages that have all their outgoing links redirect to the actual Epic websites to appear more legitimate. Do **not** log in and enter your account information on any website that doesn't use authorized URLs. Those sites aren’t real. They want you to enter your account credentials into their page (enabling them to log in as you and create fraudulent charges) or else encourage you to click down a chain of advertising referrals_ getting click-through advertising money for the person running the site. Under no circumstances are those sites able to actually grant V-Bucks. Our legal team is constantly prowling to hunt down those sites. If you’ve tried one of them in the past_ we encourage you to **change your password as soon as possible.**NLNL**The only official websites for Fortnite are <http://epicgames.com> and <http://fortnite.com>.**NLNL**Please read the Account Security Bulletin for more info:** <https://fortnitehelp.epicgames.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2921261-account-security-bulletin>

No matter how pretty they look. Some are fake webpages that have all their outgoing links redirect to the actual Epic websites to appear more legitimate. Do **not** log in and enter your account information on any website that doesn't use authorized URLs. Those sites aren’t real. They want you to enter your account credentials into their page (enabling them to log in as you and create fraudulent charges) or else encourage you to click down a chain of advertising referrals_ getting click-through advertising money for the person running the site.

560632755147374642,Sharky The King,321,They're working as hard as they really can.

People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care_ I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades_ 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Apache" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege.
