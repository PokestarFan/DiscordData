559006026376937483,LikeALol,25,In that case NLLet b=0 lol
559006072984174592,sleepytetris,35,I think he means where b is unknown
559006167540563971,LikeALol,12,Heyo tetrino
559006255096528914,LikeALol,12,How goeth it

559006473447931918,LikeALol,25,Yeah this is homework btw
559062974623383552,T-Pose Time,92,hey does anyone know how to do homework without getting distracted after literally 5 seconds
559063111710277642,LikeALol,30,Put your phone and laptop away
559063149412876288,LikeALol,69,Or install something that blocks certain apps if you need your laptop
559063343881650200,T-Pose Time,77,well my parents took my phone and i'm not sure how to block youtube on chrome
559078290690670616,Mees,57,D=(-13)^2-2*-20=129  x=(13-sqrt129)/2 or x=(13+sqrt129)/2
559078456302764044,LikeALol,83,-1/4 (-2 x + sqrt(249) + 13) (2 x + sqrt(249) - 13) is apparently how you factor it
559088650508304401,LikeALol,22,Is that times or minus
559088812173688835,LikeALol,15,X=6/yNL(6/y)+y=9
559089153338507265,LikeALol,14,do u need more
559089174574268417,berat,4,yeah
559089194991878144,berat,18,that would be nice
559089237035581462,LikeALol,30,Again is it a times or a minus
559089308183691297,LikeALol,8,At x•y=6
559089317641977857,berat,19,x+y=9 x.y=6 (x-y)^2
559089338084753419,berat,5,times
559089594872627210,LikeALol,77,well then you have 6/y+y=9 NLDo a little fraction addition to get a polynomial
559089603429269504,LikeALol,8,Solve it
559089707590615060,LikeALol,28,0.725 and 8.274 or something
559089804202213376,LikeALol,57,Them use that for y in one of the equations to get your x
559089824464764948,LikeALol,16,Then just expand
559089840340074527,LikeALol,18,Using a calculator
