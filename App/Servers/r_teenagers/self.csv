560600280907907072,EJS,75,Not entirely certain tbh. This is an example of the kind of quality it has.
560600463544680458,Léon The Unprofessional,114,<@441281322447667214> Ah fair enough_ well the XZ2 comes with some addons_ and i haven't really tried with them so
560600672299646976,Snowmaninblack,68,ok <@286587365235884032> its written on the front of your camera....
560600700468461583,Stan,559,<@286587365235884032> Thanks haha_ it's all about two things: lighting and software. My phone may be 2.5 years old and I bought it brand-new for less than $300 (great discount)_ but using custom software really helped. I'll show the difference before and after image processing in a second.NLNLBad lighting really ruins photos_ especially with phones. Small cameras like the ones used in phones just can't squeeze out enough light of the tiny sensor it used. Only with plenty of daylight the photos will look this good. This photo was taken in front of a window
560600933352865822,Snowmaninblack,58,yeah lighting is the most important factor in a picture...
560601086201823242,Stan,30,Especially with phone pictures
560601106795986964,Snowmaninblack,3,yep
560601253269340161,EJS,106,Ah_ I see.NLNLBut yeah_ I honestly had no idea phones even had the capability of taking something like that.

560601663438848000,Stan,58,Here's a bunch of pictures I took last summer on a holiday
560601755289780224,Stan,90,In case you want more photos from a smartphone camera that was considered mediocre in 2016
560601981106913281,Stan,54,It's amazing how well smartphone cameras work actually
560602128775643137,Stan,89,But once it gets dark or you start zooming in_ well it gets bad pretty quickly I must say
560602147410935820,EJS,220,Huh_ neat.NLIn fairness_ a lot of my misconceptions probably comes from the fact that my only proper experience with photos taken on smartphones is with the one my sister uses_ which is a 2009 model if I recall correctly.
560602421877800961,Stan,63,Ahh that probably explains a lot. Smartphones are evolving fast
560602468912988190,Stan,19,Really_ really fast
