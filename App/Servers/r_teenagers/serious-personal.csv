558463875218145281,kermitjoinsthekremlin,78,my grandma passed away in front of my grandad cuz of respiratory complications
558463896919343114,Metallum_,1458,Okay_ so long story short_ my ex and I got back together secretly_ my parents don't like her because her mom is a legit liar. I don't have a car yet but she has her classes in town when I'm at home at that time so we decided on her way back from classes I would "take a walk" and we would meet up. We've been talking for about a month again I've known her for 4 years total. Anyway so we get to walking_ holding hands and talking to each other. I live near a river so we decided to walk down to it lots of houses but it's all in a forested area. We get there are relive the old times when we kayaked and what not_ sat down on the riverbank and just cuddle/held each other. We talked and talked and this went on for a half hour then my dad (who is at work) calls me and asks me where I'm at because my mom is freaking out on him because I took longer then my usual 20 minutes on a walk. I tell my dad I'm getting home_ we start walking up the stairs that lead up from the river and on one of the landings I take both her hands in mine and face her (context we've only ever kissed once like a year ago before we split up legit on the same day and it was rushed) so I ask her "Think I can make up for that kiss on that friday forever ago" and she legit says "I can't" and bolts up the stairs. I had to get home so I run back home and get on with life. I haven't contacted her yet_ I think I know what I'm going to say to her but I honestly don't know how I feel
558463917710639115,kermitjoinsthekremlin,36,hes a doctor n her tried to save her
558463935171395624,ANuGgEt,129,I mean_ I don't even have a biological paternal grandfather. Never met him_ my father hasn't talked to him since he was 10 or so.

558464527780544522,Gamzee,41,metallum can you possibly talk to her irl
558464553764126730,Gamzee,28,and just talk about you guys
558464571074150451,Zelefant,85,so as far as the new school goes how can i open up to people without being awkward ad
558464582490914817,Gamzee,36,sit down and decide if it's worth it
558464617085665280,Gamzee,52,or at least try to find out exactl what made her run
558464633283936272,Zelefant,65,because i think thats how i got the punching bag rep at my school
558464660194459651,Metallum_,89,we only get to see each other about once a month and never get to be alone at those times
558464668029681666,kermitjoinsthekremlin,99,look kekvin_ pushing past grief and numbness is the hardest part_ but otherwise you fall into a pit
558464704494829568,kermitjoinsthekremlin,10,keep going
558464766390304768,Metallum_,66,we've texted everyday for about a month since we got back together
558464778243276822,Kekvin,70,I knew this day was gonna come_ but I didn’t know it like be this soon
558464790641770496,kermitjoinsthekremlin,49,hold the knowledge that he died happy_ peacefully
558464876356567052,skysword2,33,i mean death is hard to deal with
558464884036206598,kermitjoinsthekremlin,79,no one is ever ready for death even if they have rationalized it or embraced it
558464892789719041,skysword2,26,thats the human experience
558464917162819605,kermitjoinsthekremlin,1,^

558464954232078356,skysword2,20,but it stops hurting
558464969717579806,skysword2,14,pretty quickly
558464994161983500,skysword2,17,life keeps moving

558465122511618058,Kekvin,88,I’ll live on with hopefulness_ knowing that I will see him once again in the far future.
558465169357799427,kermitjoinsthekremlin,5,aight
558465198931968026,Gamzee,8,metallum
558465216317358092,skysword2,14,go for it mate
558465228027723816,Gamzee,39,she could be too pressured cause of the
558465284235591682,Gamzee,50,fact that it's kind forbidden your relationship???
558465300559953920,Gamzee,27,idk if that makes sense but
558465335884382208,Gamzee,42,I think you should just try talking to her
558465372798582794,Gamzee,54,try asking her if she wants to be in this relationship
558465389676462081,ANuGgEt,1,^
558465448463695911,Gamzee,24,ask her to be honest too
558465513571876874,ANuGgEt,86,And if she doesn't_ its best for both of you to just remain friends. And ONLY friends.
558465538620260361,Metallum_,114,shes repeated told me she has_ I will talk to her though at least over text of discord if meeting up might be hard
558465628365783052,ANuGgEt,45,I think its best to do these things in person
558465676570918952,ANuGgEt,28,Or at least video/voice call
558465693201465355,Metallum_,144,literally we got back together and said "this time we aren't going to worry about plans or the future_ or anything_ and be open with each other"
558465848377999371,Metallum_,131,I would rather do it in person but the only way to do that is if we meet up and that's pretty hard with my parents and her schedule
558465962693623821,Metallum_,111,I've kept this 100% hidden from them because they think she's really bad for me and her mom is an outright liar
558465993643655190,Gamzee,53,sometimes people say things in the heat of the moment
558466057208201226,Gamzee,64,can you tell your parents you're going to the store or some shit
558466187328225312,Metallum_,105,we live out of town and the only way for us to meet up is if she drives to me on her way back from places
558466334552358922,Metallum_,112,also my mom freaked out today because I took such a long walk and is threatening to not let me take them anymore
558466348854935554,Metallum_,22,things are such a mess
558466518640492545,Gamzee,9,dude lmao
558466538810900480,Gamzee,20,your mom sounds like
558466564370857985,Gamzee,4,well
558466588374728711,Gamzee,44,she's probably paranoid you're seeing the ex
558466589653991445,Metallum_,15,over bearing af
558466608515776524,Metallum_,9,she is...
558466617751765024,Metallum_,13,I know she is
558466732532957185,Metallum_,66,and I hate hiding it but it's either it's hidden or nothing at all
558466806520479744,ANuGgEt,129,Quick question: (I'm not saying this to be racist or anything_ but my mom is like this (Asian and overcontrolling) Are you Asian?
558466853081579520,ANuGgEt,34,Don't answer if you don't' want to
558466937970229248,ANuGgEt,69,Because I went through this same exact thing (parents and everything)
558467334734348289,Metallum_,307,it's fine_ am actually not asian but family is very religious (as am I) roman catholic. My parents literally told me they just don't want things to turn out badly for me the first time they found out about her_ and since my parents know her mom and her mom is psycho they don't want me to be with her at all
558467470827192340,Gamzee,15,ah yes catholic
558467498815520778,Metallum_,14,yea you get it
558467547779825665,ANuGgEt,2,Oh
558467578960281615,Gamzee,44,id ask her if she feels like she can hide it
558467596995919883,ANuGgEt,14,understandable
558467623361445907,Gamzee,70,it might be better for both of you mentally if you just break it apart
558467653858099221,ANuGgEt,1,^
558467690956849171,ANuGgEt,34,Note: my situation didn't end well
558467701429764128,Gamzee,68,she might be breaking under the pressure of having to keep it secret
558467734275358721,Metallum_,23,See I'd agree with that
558467769734135819,Metallum_,24,that's a very good point
558467775350308864,Gamzee,48,but she might not want to actually part with you
558467829989638164,Metallum_,38,dude that sounds exactly like the case
558467883093721088,ANuGgEt,79,But if you keep going back and forth_ its unhealthy and damaging to both of you
558467899728330752,Gamzee,104,i dont mean to sound like a bitch but you need to talk to her and find out if this is what she's feeling
558467962097631262,Gamzee,60,because if you hate keeping it a secret_ she probably is too
558467970800549898,Metallum_,101,like it hurt so much the first time it all fell apart but this time I don't think I'll be heartbroken
558468089243631618,Gamzee,96,yall wanna be together but if you truly love each other_ youll let the other go for mental sakes
558468110630518794,Gamzee,27,if that's the case_ that is

558468249319374848,Metallum_,128,you're so right_ I don't want to message her just yet because I think she probably needs some space to think about us/today also
558468429057753115,ANuGgEt,2,Um
558468541712433159,Metallum_,153,I'm not afraid to ask her this stuff_ I told her when we started everything again that this time I'm not going to be shy or stammer if something comes up

558468623438446592,Dayton | Twenty,61,Because apparently giving a shit about how you look = you gay

558468663208968193,Dayton | Twenty,58,Also the fact I have more female friends than male friensd
558468714203316225,kermitjoinsthekremlin,70,apparently for girls not giving a shit bout how you look makes you gay
558468729093226507,kermitjoinsthekremlin,10,weird huh?
558468778225303562,Dayton | Twenty,105,Like I'm sorry I always make sure my hair is done well and that I wear button up shirts and leather shoes
558468791026319360,Dayton | Twenty,28,But that doesn't make me gay
558468929899462708,Metallum_,190,ouch that really sucks day_ I know a guy who everyone thinks hes gay (he walks the walk and does the talk) but it's just because his dad isn't really in his life and he gets a really bad rep

558469184263290885,Dayton | Twenty,130,It doesn't bother me that much but I just hate the connotation of dressing well/having more female friends than male friends = gay

558764974097563648,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),33,Okay lemme put it in full context
558765017739165709,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),52,I wanted to date the first twin about 3-4 months ago
558765035292196865,luk,76,<@!246806137532448768> u watched amadeus? i love that movie. also why scream
558765075985334313,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),50,That went horrible as there was no mutual interest
558765181963075604,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),79,Now_ 4 months later_ I’m friends with the other twin (the one I didn’t talk to)
558765189923733680,luk,23,it b like dat sometimes
558765202187747328,luk,2,ok
558765226284154881,luk,22,so u wanna date twin2?
558765281007370256,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),33,No I wanna be friends with twin 2
558765323784945665,luk,25,and try again with twin1?
558765365979512833,AustinAPB,26,Yeah <@215166909807591425>
558765375399919617,AustinAPB,9,good shit
558765381561614347,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),74,She’s really pretty but it would be...suspect if I went for the other twin
558765443477798919,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),21,No twin1 is over with
558765466458521620,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),37,We don’t even talk anymore as friends
558765481826320400,luk,2,ok
558765525879226371,luk,39,so twin2 is the only one in the picture
558765576164474920,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),113,I’m saying it would be awkward to be friends with twin2 because twin1 and everyone else would think the wrong way
558765643466407958,luk,36,so u dont wanna date either of them?
558765730221522950,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),45,Okay let’s just forget about twin1 completely
558765829336858624,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),143,Twin2 is really pretty and yeah I would think about dating her but it would be awkward because I tried to do the same thing with the other twin
558765891408494593,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),60,So it would look like I’m just hopping from one to the other
558765904200990720,luk,9,yea i see
558765933859176508,luk,34,like shes the sloppy seconds kinda
558766012279816302,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),29,Not really sloppy seconds imo
558766069548974087,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),75,She is the prettier one she was just dating my douchebag friend at the time
558766077631528970,luk,50,no yea ofc just that'd be the way ppl might see it
558766098984730664,luk,54,as if ur trying w her cus it didnt work the first time
558766263351115784,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),135,(I’m not calling him a douchebag because of that_ he asked my other friend for nudes multiple times so I don’t think too highly of him)
558766301552705548,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),35,Yeah that’s what it would look like
558766556092432384,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),31,Oh yeah reply to the story part
558766586702332031,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),23,So do I click yes or no
558766634832101386,luk,27,this is twin2's story right
558766651470905383,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),4,Yeah
558766695313833985,luk,24,damn man tough situation
558766728046313484,luk,3,ugh
558766752679591936,luk,1,🤔
558766830185873410,luk,43,if u say yes then shes gonna see that right
558766863685779456,luk,56,and ur gonna be on a list of other ppl who also said yes
558766885546754059,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),32,No matter what I say she sees it
558766952840036353,luk,63,so if ur close maybe shed choose you over other ppl on the list
558767000818548737,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),37,Oh no I’d be near the bottom as of rn
558767001347031040,luk,51,if ur not close_ then maybe shell pick someone else
558767022415020033,luk,6,yea ok
558767125871853571,luk,47,so if u say yes she'll know there's an interest
558767219798966288,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),16,Essentially yeah
558767228271591444,luk,101,just interest in haning out thats all she knows ofc she can superimpose her presuppositions onto that
558767298241101845,luk,37,but if u say yes and she doesnt reply

558768017241276417,luk,88,yea so maybe the fact that shes kept the streak is indicative of an interest towards you

558772196978196500,Gamzee,41,i feel like personality is more important

558772254247223331,luk,3,def
558772321050034207,luk,55,cus if ur not attracted then its basically a friendship

558772664882167814,Gamzee,74,it can put a massive strain on your friendships if they dont dig the chick

558772759572906016,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),62,Well they just don’t like her because she’s kinda bratty maybe

558772871401570314,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),75,I’m not really in love with her because I’m morally on the fence about this

558781307857928212,Owen,34,Well I actually can't relate there
558781433704087552,Owen,67,My mom was in a shock program when I was in either 3rd or 5th grade
558781440880410654,Owen,14,Can't remember
558781502167580674,Owen,89,it was for 6 months and I was on the verge of being taken into custody of any of my aunts
558781551094136843,IceWap,9,oh im sry
558781609319333909,Owen,104,Thankfully my grandmother fought for the custody and won and I could still live with my mother afterward
558781635638853632,Owen,52,God I will never forget the last time I ever saw her
558781685567848460,Owen,36,Laying in her bed_ delirious_ sickly
558781726256529422,Owen,37,Shit like this changes a man_ ya know
558781753180028978,Gamzee,50,i remember when i used to read so many books lmaoo
558784850564349952,CRAZED MERC,395,I hurt my leg in school today. I must’ve accidentally slammed it against a wall at some point exiting a class or something. I tell my step mother and she consoles me and gives me a cream to treat itNLNLI come back home_ tell my father the exact same lines I told my step mother and he gives me a dirty look_ accuses me of having hurt it by climbing a wall and tells me to not be an idiot next time
558784871921614869,CRAZED MERC,1,🙃
558785004948291624,Owen,44,That doesn't mean they don't love you dearly
558785117296787476,CRAZED MERC,65,Are you kidding me? He went from calm demeanour to outright angry
558785148863250453,CRAZED MERC,26,Just because I hurt my leg
558785222305513482,CRAZED MERC,31,And in a malicious tone as well
558785257541861377,CRAZED MERC,29,Not even playful or consoling
558785356963512360,Owen,214,No_ I'm not kidding you. My grandmother is the same way. People get stressed_ and they take that negative energy out on others either without thinking about it or merely to get the negative energy tension released.
558785511486128148,CRAZED MERC,94,It’s not nice to come home to have your father patronise you for accidentally hurting your leg
558785568448708648,CRAZED MERC,14,I don’t get it
558785588111736865,CRAZED MERC,19,Why is he like this
558785685901934592,Owen,50,Well first option on the table is stress obviously
558785742822703124,CRAZED MERC,103,He then comes down to the bathroom where I was washing my hands and doesn’t even say a word or anything
558785764775690241,CRAZED MERC,20,Just gives me a look
558785868182192130,CRAZED MERC,106,I noped the fuck out_ put the cream on my leg and went to bed before he has a chance to say anything to me
558785879561207810,Owen,45,Then why don't you initiate the conversation?
558785965649559553,CRAZED MERC,63,You don’t get it. There’s no talking to him when he’s like that
558786007974150145,CRAZED MERC,58,When he gets in this mood he’s always the one in the right
558786032947167243,CRAZED MERC,21,Only he is ever right
558786211062480896,CRAZED MERC,40,I try to talk to him and he won’t listen
558786419733168179,CRAZED MERC,96,He’s got issues and won’t ever address them because therapy is for crazy people according to him
558786477023166504,CRAZED MERC,27,I swear to god he’s bipolar
558786485508374557,Owen,394,I think I do get it. My mother was like that a lot. She lived in the same house yet she would only ever look at me and never initiate conversation_ she'd stay sedentary in her room for days on end and I would see her maybe once a week. It was 10 days between when I saw her on Christmas and the last day I'd ever get to see my mother before she died. My only regret is not communicating enough.
558786600369389609,CRAZED MERC,18,Sorry to hear that
558786659034988564,CRAZED MERC,13,I’m just lost
558786674042077213,CRAZED MERC,14,I don’t get it
558786712583798797,CRAZED MERC,30,He was fine and then he wasn’t
558786737867063296,Owen,15,We're all lost.
558786751506939915,CRAZED MERC,40,Like someone flipped a switch inside him
558786777775865869,CRAZED MERC,11,It pains me
558786798025703434,CRAZED MERC,34,I just want a normal father but no
558786833429954561,CRAZED MERC,36,I had to get the crazy music fanatic
558786895585476608,Owen,33,Yeah_ life gives us all a beating
558786906075299853,CRAZED MERC,79,Who’s probably bipolar and has major mental issues but won’t ever talk about it
558787000480563227,CRAZED MERC,102,I want a normal home life but no_ I have to be worried about if he’s coming home in a good mood or not
558787092126236673,Owen,106,Everything happens for a reason. I guess you had to become stronger from those situations for some reason.
558787107632578571,CRAZED MERC,102,Or if he’s gonna get in one of his moods and “teach” me music where he expects you to get it first try
558787174204702752,CRAZED MERC,14,I’m not strong
558787217502371860,CRAZED MERC,35,This shit has worn me down mentally
558787275052285953,CRAZED MERC,71,The only time I can forget all that and pretend I’m normal is at school
558787293930848260,Owen,69,And through that you train your discipline like a muscle and it grows
558787389791666188,CRAZED MERC,46,When it’s constantly every 2-3 days I doubt it
558787409719066634,CRAZED MERC,21,It’s been 5 years now
558787423564333087,CRAZED MERC,14,I ain’t strong
558787470372765698,CRAZED MERC,57,And will probably only ever be when I’m out of this house
558787512647286819,Owen,68,In my entire 15 years I don't remember a single day of it being easy
558787612945547265,CRAZED MERC,35,He won’t be here tomorrow thank god
558787632579215367,CRAZED MERC,18,I’m free for a day
558787816239136769,Owen,39,You are what you make of your situation
558787849588047873,CRAZED MERC,164,I can do whatever I want without him patronising me constantly. Nothing bad of course_ literally just taking a walk but he always insists that I stay near the house
558787908929060874,CRAZED MERC,24,Well_ if that’s the case
558788103209222154,CRAZED MERC,159,I’m a complex teenager who has major issues himself and will probably have the sad switch flipped on when he gets home and pretends everything is fine for once
558788160016875530,CRAZED MERC,31,After a wholesome day at school
558788240836919311,CRAZED MERC,20,I don’t care anymore
558788253021503489,CRAZED MERC,12,2 more years
558788266162389014,CRAZED MERC,12,And I’m gone
558788359070285832,CRAZED MERC,99,I’ll get a therapist and talk about my shitty feelings and get these shitty thoughts out of my head
558788400384311336,CRAZED MERC,29,And maybe I can live at peace
558788881588289546,Owen,289,Well_ instead of getting my act together and getting a headstart on living without the shoulders of a parent to cry or lie on at age 15_ I could've turned to drugs [I was also abusing drugs in August 2018] or I could've just stopped caring in general and let myself fall into a depression.
558789020071493644,CRAZED MERC,28,I won’t ever resort to drugs
558789056062947338,CRAZED MERC,49,I’ve seen enough crap to go down that rabbit hole
558789063235338262,Owen,61,That is good but there are other negative ways to handle life
558789123385589802,CRAZED MERC,4,Well
558789140250886164,CRAZED MERC,17,Hopefully one day
558789171863355393,CRAZED MERC,30,I’ll stop feeling these things
558789196337119232,CRAZED MERC,26,And feel something genuine
558789210014744576,Owen,59,Are you going to wait_ or are you going to take initiative?
558789267636224000,Owen,64,I can promise you if you choose to wait it will 99% never happen
558789290604232704,CRAZED MERC,33,Can’t take initiative. I’ve tried
558789322791321600,CRAZED MERC,40,I have actually yelled at my father once
558789380521590804,CRAZED MERC,52,To get his shit straight and to stop being like this
558789428072415233,Owen,52,Yelling back at your father is not taking initiative
558789502580293652,CRAZED MERC,83,Why should he be able to talk shit to me and my brothers but when I do it it’s bad?
558789573434408960,Owen,57,Who's saying it's not bad when he talks shit to you guys?
558789698324135938,CRAZED MERC,11,Haha oh man
558789714774327297,CRAZED MERC,14,I’m so screwed
558789733501894658,CRAZED MERC,18,Music school yaaay
558789792033406976,CRAZED MERC,70,Can’t wait for another 2 years at something I’m good at but don’t like
558789869065732096,CRAZED MERC,11,Itll be fun
558789969414717443,CRAZED MERC,38,I’ll be the dream my old man never had
558790152798076928,Owen,92,You can choose to have that mindset_ or you can choose a better mindset and outlook on life.
558790192274604033,Owen,56,I can't tell you how to look at life_ I do not know you.
558790297149243396,CRAZED MERC,12,I can’t dude
558790307471294491,CRAZED MERC,16,It’s over for me
558790330401423380,CRAZED MERC,35,Might as well just go along with it
558790346793025567,CRAZED MERC,18,Least it pays well
558790436626366494,CRAZED MERC,60,Maybe with someone kinder as my teacher I’ll grow to like it
558790438564134927,Owen,25,Why do you say you can't?
558790551466541101,CRAZED MERC,79,Because if I take control of my own life I lose my old man. I’ll be dead to him
558790555618770945,Owen,67,If you are unwilling to improve_ that's where this discussion ends.
558790607259172884,Splodinate,4,dude
558790620726951936,CRAZED MERC,37,If I ain’t a musician I’m dead to him
558790657456734209,Splodinate,15,hold on one sec
558790704768483348,Splodinate,30,i'm in a very similar position
558790754114338838,Splodinate,72,only difference is that my parents won't let me go into school for music
558790767372402700,CRAZED MERC,50,And it’s not like I haven’t tried to improve yeah?
558790807054974977,CRAZED MERC,13,Day after day
558790898243338240,CRAZED MERC,17,Nothing’s changed
558790922201202698,Owen,59,List at least 5 ways you have attempted to improve yourself
558790939540324412,Owen,33,This can be improvements anywhere
558790960914628619,Owen,29,skills_ mindset_ habits_ etc.
558791270428835851,CRAZED MERC,222,I’ve practiced my instrument by myself without my fatherNLNLI’ve been doing more exercise by myself NLNLI’ve been eating healthier NLNLI’ve been going out moreNLNLI’ve interacted with more people at my school and made more friends
558791283376914462,Jack Edmonds,350,Jesus. If you spend your whole life being complacent_ nothing will happen. The answer to everything isn't just get down and wait for it to blow over. Becayse life isn't in phases. It's a fluid thing. Factors change all the time_ and wasting what little time you have on this planet being complacent and miserable isn't the solution 9 times out of ten
558791397646270505,Jack Edmonds,53,I think you should probably talk to your dad about it
558791424393609246,CRAZED MERC,54,I’m telling you_ I’m only ever unhappy at my own house
558791449164906529,CRAZED MERC,12,I have tried
558791461018271754,CRAZED MERC,10,Many times
558791478684549123,CRAZED MERC,23,So many I’ve lost count
558791496048967710,CRAZED MERC,21,But he doesn’t listen
558791621097947154,CRAZED MERC,108,He won’t ever listen and he won’t ever change. He promises change but that’s been a dead promise for 5 years
558791654845186068,skull legion,22,i feek gross right now
558791669563130100,CRAZED MERC,46,So what am I supposed to do. My hands are tied

558791777788624897,skull legion,22,and its over a yearold
558791781697716235,Jack Edmonds,65,Okay. This is a little extreme. But you could offer an ultimatum.
558791805995581480,weeb,24,Imagine downloading porn
558791845241684008,weeb,37,Laughs in just watching it in pornhub
558791989282209802,Jack Edmonds,166,Just tell him that you're going to do what you want_ and if he refuses_ just leave. If you have somewhere to go_ go there. If not_ just spend a few hours to yourself.
558792008752169007,skull legion,26,well my internet is shitty
558792016201515008,skull legion,10,so i do it

558792262029541396,CRAZED MERC,41,I wish I could’ve had a different outcome
558792394783326228,Jack Edmonds,90,Same. I just feel exhausted from existing. My mind_ body and soul is damaged beyond belief
558792470884778035,CRAZED MERC,47,I would’ve left him years ago but I can’t leave
558792479877496833,CRAZED MERC,9,My mother
558792551960936461,CRAZED MERC,59,She will be all alone with him and she’ll be so heartbroken
558792593253728268,CRAZED MERC,36,And I love her too much to leave her
558792670130995215,CRAZED MERC,44,He’ll probably take his anger out on her too
558792675848093767,Splodinate,172,With everything going on at home_ which from what I can tell happens to you too <@!181833145908199424> _  it's always painful to just live. And I know how painful it can me
558792702062231553,Splodinate,3,be*
558792736493273108,CRAZED MERC,6,I just
558792941343080449,CRAZED MERC,144,Want it to stop and it hasn’t stopped for 6 goddamn years. I thought after I chose him instead of my step mother everything would be over but no
558793028089675777,CRAZED MERC,75,I can’t ever catch a break I always have to have one bullshit after another
558793091830775808,Splodinate,32,So you have no time to yourself?
558793162219454474,CRAZED MERC,48,Only at school and when I’m by myself in my room
558793242087391253,CRAZED MERC,60,I want to go out and take walks but the old man won’t let me
558793258516348929,Splodinate,21,I'm just the same way
558793342767595520,Splodinate,90,If you want to go for a walk_ I think you have every right to just walk right out the door
558793375617253387,CRAZED MERC,16,Haha yeah I wish
558793397729624065,Splodinate,14,I mean legally

558793440695943208,CRAZED MERC,67,He’ll probably have a stroke the second I leave without telling him
558793450741301253,weeb,25,Just tell him to get bent
558793503786795009,CRAZED MERC,6,I have

558793520501227523,CRAZED MERC,15,On one occasion
558793573525618708,CRAZED MERC,43,I told him everything that I thought of him
558793602029846528,CRAZED MERC,22,Afterwards I felt good
558793620719796225,CRAZED MERC,10,Great even
558793622217162759,Splodinate,34,Wow_ that takes quite some courage
558793680119398428,CRAZED MERC,42,Then he sent my and my brothers to my room
558793732015521801,CRAZED MERC,39,And we stayed there the whole afternoon
558793772604063745,CRAZED MERC,29,And I just watched the sunset
558793833207431181,Splodinate,35,Are your brothers older or younger?
558793887276072970,CRAZED MERC,76,The orange colours mixing with purple and creating pretty colours in my room
558793923443818516,CRAZED MERC,19,And the shadows too
558793967844720680,CRAZED MERC,39,And for once in my life I felt at peace
558793995250171906,Splodinate,42,I never get that because of the darn trees
558794009988825129,CRAZED MERC,16,And it was sweet
558794037176434709,Splodinate,39,but in the morning I do get the sunrise
558794063063678978,Splodinate,33,It must have been a great feeling

558798044087451673,ZhaoZentral,51,I'm really busy with playing music all the time tho
558798070238674949,Splodinate,80,But if you want to work then you can probaby find some people in school who work
558798070415097876,Snik,12,so I'm happy
558798140501786635,Splodinate,52,I know_ I play music too. It gets very busy at times
558798230788243488,Snik,27,Band class seems really fub
558798240078757908,Snik,3,fun
558798303811207178,ZhaoZentral,13,it is fun yea
558798367329746959,Earo,65,Told my friend I like dick today_ from that he thinks I'm a furry
558798391908499456,Earo,1,🤔
558798456622284810,Splodinate,32,He's definitely a pro in parkour
558798482924765184,Splodinate,35,he makes great leaps to conclusions
558798510288273428,Earo,3,Oof
558798579012075570,Snik,63,one of my friends who is gay told me who they're into yesterday
558798602978328586,Earo,21,He's not the smartest
558798613275344908,Snik,41,felt nice to know they really do trust me
558798734834532392,Earo,24,It does feel really nice
558798812869689346,Earo,73,I act like a complete edgy fuck because I'm not good at talking to people
558798898504925194,Earo,35,So it's not often people talk to me
558798934948970507,Snik,30,I used to isolate myself a lot
558798936270176271,Earo,18,Let alone trust me
558798968268783616,Snik,31,but i joined my schools theatre
558799020408045569,Snik,36,doing construction work for the play
558799087743533075,Snik,47,and I'm so much better at talking to people now
558799161458294784,Snik,54,and better at having healthy relationships with people
558799174435602433,Splodinate,81,The way I've gotten better at talking to people was by pretending to be confident
558799208845541378,Splodinate,34,until it wasn't pretending anymore
558799246359265283,Earo,53,If you pretend you're confident you aren't pretending
558799313220927498,Splodinate,39,Like I would pretend I wasn't panicking
558799358657691651,Earo,18,It's not that easy
558799400693137408,Splodinate,29,I know_ it really wasn't easy
558799458650030090,Splodinate,20,I'm not saying it is
558799472554016771,IdoCocaine,60,<@212114977253752832> yo i always thought about it like that
558799701240184842,IdoCocaine,86,you cant pretend to be confident if you pretend to be confident you ar ejust confident
558799750153895936,Earo,7,Exactly
558799793057431566,JohnIsDone,3,uhm
558799804130656273,JohnIsDone,3,no?
558799878986137601,Splodinate,103,Sometimes I would think of someone who was really good at talking to people and pretend that I was them
558799908971216896,Splodinate,40,and that whatever I said wouldn't matter
558799953716314143,Earo,23,I can't think like that
558800008326021163,Confused Chubchar,218,Ppl following along (they usually only come in like 4 more hours but here) so asked my GF and no she's good im not clingy and shell try to kiss me outside of school cause she's shy but I can go at it she doesn't mind 😙
558800031487098880,Confused Chubchar,27,Or at least it's like pecks
558800041972727829,Confused Chubchar,13,Okay carry on
558800066329182209,Splodinate,60,I don't expect anyone to because it's so absurd how I did it
558800150097690640,JohnIsDone,20,that's how you do it
558800162428813323,Splodinate,91,It didn't even work that well because I still can't start a conversation for the life of me
558800205806305281,Splodinate,28,but it's better than nothing
558800224508968970,JohnIsDone,86,people will be comfortable with you around and friendly if they think you're confident
558800231916109864,ZhaoZentral,78,I just try to remember that people won't really remember all the awkward stuff
558800255249022976,JohnIsDone,28,then you'll become confident
558800286504845339,ZhaoZentral,40,then i don't get snagged on that thought
558800390779306025,ZhaoZentral,20,And i feel more free
558800391047872543,JohnIsDone,38,<@229097310494261248> congrats I guess

558801481403465728,ZhaoZentral,15,have a good one
558801492924956681,Earo,63,That sounds better than RL_ but you'd be fucked after waking up

558801550118617088,ZhaoZentral,40,There's a girl i'd like to get closer to
558801550567276565,Splodinate,8,Bye John
558801567617384448,JohnIsDone,90,lmao the main thing which stopped me from getting a gf was I have literally no social life
558801575242629120,JohnIsDone,3,uhm
558801587393527830,Earo,16,Talk to her then

558801748639350805,ZhaoZentral,29,we see each other once a week
558801775948464133,ZhaoZentral,25,but snap almost every day
558801828364419072,ZhaoZentral,21,pretty much every dat
558801835163516938,JohnIsDone,13,like streaks?

558801935743057921,JohnIsDone,5,nicce
558801950183915520,ZhaoZentral,37,kinda small convos throughout the day
558801976255840256,ZhaoZentral,25,sometimes they get deeper
558802141440114698,JohnIsDone,28,do you think she's into you?
558802157420412938,ZhaoZentral,5,maybe
558802196326514690,ZhaoZentral,39,I dont know if she dropped hints or not
558802222964801560,ZhaoZentral,25,i can't read those things
558802310659047432,JohnIsDone,52,that's because girls will do the subtlest hints ever
558802341223071755,ZhaoZentral,4,mmmm
558802412425707550,ZhaoZentral,43,she once waited around a corner to shock me
558802456046206976,ZhaoZentral,27,the situation needs context
558802569976086531,ZhaoZentral,15,you wanna hear?
558802584257822750,JohnIsDone,11,gib context
558802653296066570,ZhaoZentral,17,We had this class
558802716378267659,ZhaoZentral,52,and it was one of my friends last day on this course
558802817662451717,ZhaoZentral,73,we wouldn't see each other often after so me and him had a proper goodbye
558802973569056778,ZhaoZentral,77,this younger kid_ who I'm certain likes her was kinda trying to cling to her.
558803033601998891,JohnIsDone,3,ugh
558803040807944202,ZhaoZentral,48,we usually follow each other out to the car park
558803118155104266,ZhaoZentral,52,but i thought i'd say goodbye to my friend this time
558803204851236888,ZhaoZentral,67,i tell her this and assume she'll just continue out to the car park
558803308777832448,ZhaoZentral,41,then i get my friend and we turn a corner
558803320538529804,ZhaoZentral,5,"boo"
558803356186050560,ZhaoZentral,28,she didn't actually scare me
558803390336073740,ZhaoZentral,9,but yknow
558803397080252417,JohnIsDone,4,okay
558803407247245333,JohnIsDone,8,question
558803436787859456,JohnIsDone,32,do you think that that is a hint
558803463404781617,ZhaoZentral,9,UGHHHHHHH

558803495419904020,ZhaoZentral,9,could be?
558803521093500928,ZhaoZentral,23,I just obsessed over it
558803549723557908,JohnIsDone,53,because personally I think that's just a friend thing
558803555159638016,JohnIsDone,3,but
558803599333916672,ZhaoZentral,26,was kinda out of character
558803623061094421,ZhaoZentral,5,wasnt
558803630354989056,JohnIsDone,45,it all depends on how she was acting and shit
558803637531574312,ZhaoZentral,12,expecting it
558803660428017668,JohnIsDone,26,it's not just what they do
558803665482285076,JohnIsDone,2,so
558803673921093632,JohnIsDone,8,could be

558804311706959892,ZhaoZentral,4,yeah
558804333060292619,ZhaoZentral,23,I've thought about that

558831545645793281,Owen,33,Well moreso the kidneys I believe
558837089098006541,Starfire1281,395,<@481585290176233482> you can't get addicted to Advil. You can definitely overuse it and get a tolerance to it but you cannot get addicted. This is coming from someone who gets migraines constantly and has abused Advil.. I'm not proud of it and have probably ruined my liver but take it from me you don't want to do that.. just to comfort you that you're not addicted you just don't want to hurt
558837123189571590,Nelace,113,Have you considered going to a doctor about the headaches ? It could be something more serious like a brain tumor
558837180928360470,Starfire1281,26,Chiropractor had helped me
558837229322240010,Starfire1281,22,And check you eyes too

558837533094445059,wikipedia is credible,52,Another good thing to take for headaches is caffeine
558837565445111821,wikipedia is credible,14,Or just eating

558843743592251423,ShootTheMessenger,137,I'm only asking this because I reached that point after testing where I've counted all the little objects in the room so my mind wonders.
558843833492832277,ShootTheMessenger,52,It picked her as the topic and started moving blood.
558844010853302273,ShootTheMessenger,44,I had to scream internally at mhself for it.

558852952820023307,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),128,Then my friends get pissed cause “you just get on the PS4 to talk instead of playing with us just get out if you’re not playing”

558856554401759232,stan 鏡音リン,120,bc if i was playing a game w/a  friend and they spent more time talking rather than being focused i'd be annoyed too ngl
558856743766196239,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),62,Okay so pretty much I was playing a different game and talking
558856813903085569,Doppio’s here bois (Jayden),98,Like it’s been a long week and I’ve been stressed out and I just needed to play something relaxing

558859431891304468,֍ella֎,3,yes
558859476791197699,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,16,but I don't know
558859525797445635,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,25,but that's life I suppose
558859577274400770,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,51,being clueless and figuring stuff out along the way
558860110609252372,Saliva,53,Why do you ask about childhood? <@388801706076667906>
558860719890628609,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,362,Idk just moving to college has made me a bit nostalgic NLlike I thought a "blank slate" would mean the opportunity to do betterNLI am improvingNLbut I am still me and have to put up with screwing upNLNLIt feels like I didn't have as much worry or as much care when I was a kidNLI'm a better person now I'd say_ but it still feels like I've lost part of what made me me
558861184409927690,Saliva,186,I mean_ I think missing being a kid is a something to miss_ but I don't it particularly makes you you. Maybe it makes you who you were because you have to change as you get older I think
558861411363717151,Saliva,95,Kinda like the old you is in the past and the past isn't something to base decisions etc off of
558861489327308819,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,109,I've become a lot more pessimisticNLI was always a bit on that side_ but didn't overly concern myself about it
558861504720404510,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,4,true
558861620550303754,Saliva,85,Sounds like you've started living more in the present though if improvement is coming
558861642171940875,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,89,I've made some mistakes recently that shouldn't have been madeNLI knew something was wrong
558861660111241216,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,3,hmm
558861674308960277,Saliva,26,Failure is bound to happen
558861725898637334,Saliva,23,Can't be avoided really
558861870623227914,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,128,idk sometimes it feels like I'm focusing myself more on what could go wrong in the future over what's going right in the present
558861878739206144,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,4,true
558861950231248909,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,52,but there are some mistakes that there is no redoing
558862000453713921,Saliva,64,Was it like just awfully obvious or bad that you worry about it?
558862078689935390,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,4,what
558862193815453717,Saliva,48,The mistakes that were bad_ why are they so bad?
558862332701310989,Saliva,33,Sorry_ yeah_ I meant the mistakes
558863095603134475,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,448,my bird died a painful death because I misplaced a few hundred dollars and then didn't kill her when it was too bad for recoveryNLI relocated the money so it shouldn't happen again but what's done is doneNLI am capable of quickly killing things to put them out of their misery (had to do that to a tiny  lizard I found with its guts spilling out that would not have made it) but couldn't give the same merciful death to my own petNLnatural death sucks
558863287383490571,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,110,other stuff like screwing up a project or annoying a friend or saying the wrong thing to someone I can correct
558863317427552258,Saliva,42,So I can understand: what's the money for?
558863319721705472,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,16,but this is done
558863332963123220,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,3,vet
558863371504451594,Saliva,15,Ok_ makes sense
558863568980672546,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,147,I had been sticking money into a savings account and didn't realize that it was same account as parents' that they used for my school/grocery stuff
558863644285206531,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,53,and oh my out of sight out of mind is too true for me
558863807804473346,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,110,it didn't occur to me that the money I set aside actually existed until my parents told me how much I saved up
558863905397407744,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,32,which was about 10 days too late
558863966877777921,Saliva,251,I mean_ for the project and the friend at least: just thinking about how much those will really impact you is something to take into account. Like if they won't mean much to you later than don't worry about it now too much since it won't in the future
558864030979194920,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,12,yeah I don't
558864073375350804,Saliva,78,For the saying the wrong thing that can't be too hard to fix if it's worked on
558864126622040065,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,89,it's just the stuff that was my responsibility that actually mattered that is the problem
558864300018499630,Saliva,148,For the bird_ sorry to hear_ it just really doesn't go your way sometimes and it's sad to hear about the bird but like you said: what's done is done
558864322479128587,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,53,everyone's got their regrets if they live long enough
558864482403745793,Saliva,121,I think that if you know what the problem is (your responsibility it looks like) and you work on it things should be fine
558864520425242644,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,4,yeah
558864594756567062,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,39,it just feels like I'm not doing enough
558864672502054942,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,37,like better than most in some regards
558864719914467348,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,27,bottom line is I need a job
558864841734094869,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,83,and I'll be a legal adult soon so I can do some of that online stuff for side money
558864858943324181,Saliva,45,Been looking around then? Any luck with that?
558864880086679553,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,30,then if anything else comes up
558864920226037771,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,32,thinking rev.com for side income
558864946243436544,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,5,maybe
558864993160790017,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,38,think that's the transcription service
558865064652963850,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,52,got an internship for summer that pays a bit perhaps
558865207946903562,Saliva,50,Sounds good then_ rev.com is the caption thing no?
558865270471393280,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,10,I think so
558865383604355092,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,122,like my schedule is full-time school_ but honestly I could work 20-30 hours/week probably and come out fine if a bit tired
558865427300614154,Saliva,67,Is the interneship related at all to a career you're interested in?
558865452193808414,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,4,yeah
558865480098643998,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,14,it's at a ranh
558865501267296257,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,6,*ranch
558865507038527529,Saliva,45,Oui_ let's hope you can get enough sleep haha
558865548968984599,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,2,XD
558865590270427144,Saliva,39,Oh good_ that sounds amazing at a ranch
558865617109647375,Saliva,13,I'd love that
558865622516105216,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,12,I do hope so
558865658998161408,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,30,I'm majoring in animal science
558865727248007199,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,52,but even then I'm not really sure what I'll be doing
558865730276163586,Saliva,42,I love the simple yet fulfilling tasks tbh
558865755915943956,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,4,yeah
558865792628949012,Saliva,27,Feels like work I can enjoy
558865913013600268,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,18,that would be good
558865919158517761,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,54,I got to watch them file horse teeth NLit was a bit odd
558866064684089365,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,93,it's like I don't want to be a vet because an extra 5 years of school plus loans sounds awful
558866256640475156,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,122,but I don't want to do anything with poultry_ and am not particularly happy with certain parts of swine and dairy industry
558866313456386094,Saliva,52,Doctor stuff smh_ it is a bit much work ain't it lol
558866342015664149,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,71,beef cattle seem fine but still not what I'd probably want to do as job
558866444021006367,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,49,I think I could be okay as a vet if I was trained
558866517547155477,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,45,but I feel I'm more suited for something else
558866572475629579,Saliva,121,I just like going to my grandparents farm to help out_ I love that lifestyle_ don't care much for the job than the living
558866618554384384,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,3,huh
558866722023669761,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,60,I've heard of the "unplugging" movement I think they call it
558866861215842304,Saliva,62,That's a thing? Lmao_ I guess our family just never plugged in
558866882409529365,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,50,where you farm all day and live with little impact
558866932619542548,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,38,like I think there's still electricity
558866951611482112,Saliva,30,Well_ at least my grandparents
558867015968882708,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,59,but it's about minimizing ecological footprint or something
558867030716186624,Saliva,50,Oh yeah_ they aren't like off the grid or anything
558867182428225563,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,88,I want to travel around the US_ maybe in a camperNLbut with that comes an unstable career
558867222391685140,Saliva,73,What time is it for you btw? I'm guessing bed would be an option for you?
558867261671211030,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,4,0:18
558867290192478229,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,17,pretty early/late
558867319200415744,Saliva,21,Yeah lmao_ not tired?
558867373369720832,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,34,I can sleep in all I want tomorrow
558867414851256322,Saliva,16,If ya say so pal
558867443825770496,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,4,hehe
558867482547322890,Saliva,39,It is the weekend so no shaming from me
558867515866873859,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,25,oh wait it would be today
558867550859952129,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,31,I can sleep in all I want today
558867754732486676,Saliva,69,Eh_ no need to get technical_ my day doesn't start til the cock crows
558867783094632459,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,2,ah
558867827801718816,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,11,so like 5am
558867892406452224,Saliva,10,About yeah
558867932600467456,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,3,oof
558868092692856861,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,35,my birds usually start singing at 7
558868168416690216,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,46,but I can sleep through it if I'm tired enough
558868177388437505,Saliva,61,Where are you from? Two hours ahead of me isn't the US is it?
558868222212833287,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,7,Florida
558868268962807829,Saliva,9,Wait yeah
558868296032583690,Saliva,26,I'm just dumb or something
558868348402925578,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,28,is fineNLwe all are sometimes
558868392203780097,Saliva,40,Two hours from eleven isn't midnight smh
558868467931938846,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,9,ah whoops
558868595568803840,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,68,do you ever try to plan anything way ahead of what is even practical
558868738934571094,Saliva,102,How ahead are we talking about because if not too far but just like really detailed then yes yes yesss
558868801370980353,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,15,like 5-10 years
558868907197202463,Saliva,55,Oh no_ I don't have the mind capacity to think that far
558869019713863687,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,45,but if super detailed then maybe a few months
558869061052661770,Saliva,127,Recently I've been thinking about talking to someone I trust about things and I've thought out multiple conversations with them
558869100164546566,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,9,I do that
558869144137629708,Saliva,24,Like it's super detailed
558869231303786508,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,73,I used to have to plan what to say before I said it so I knew what to say
558869287822032912,Saliva,25,Yeah_ that's how it feels
558869291819335682,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,56,like guessing how they'd respond and addressing that too
558869361952292875,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,45,and then guessing all their responses to that
558869379891068930,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,11,etc etc etc
558869427190366230,Saliva,7,Exactly
558869479480885261,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,25,have like 10 backup plans
558869587584614400,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,60,get annoyed/concerned when they don't act according to plan?
558869657524764672,Saliva,197,For some reason I feel like I don't want to talk about things so a prominent thing is me walking into the room talking and them not being there_ and if they end up being there I walk away nervously
558869786575241226,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,2,ah
558869829189238794,Saliva,104,If things don't go somewhat the way I've thought it I just change the subject to something I can control
558869923141779456,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,100,I usually do the talking in my head but sometimes I mutter or grin to myself and people are confused
558869933618888704,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,2,ah
558869976430280724,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,32,I have been known to do that too
558870114674540575,Saliva,49,Lmao you weirdo_ I'd so be a tad confused as well
558870180193763338,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,26,sometimes I confuse myself
558870330781728788,Saliva,101,When I confuse myself I get like dizzy but good thing is that when it goes away I can clear things up
558870384968073226,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,12,that is good
558870461417521152,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,28,oh no I forgot to eat dinner

558870655878168577,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,57,but it's so late it would probably keep me up for a while
558870708118224906,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,35,it takes me excessively long to eat
558870808517148672,Saliva,87,Well_ I guess it's a matter of what's more beneficial to your health: the food or sleep
558870874053410837,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,28,idk they're both pretty good
558870922073866252,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,40,like I could just eat 2 dinners tommorow
558871030773579776,Saliva,87,I'd preferably sleep if I was tired_ but if I wasn't that tired I might as well and eat
558871078882115594,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,4,true
558871264983384076,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,38,it would be cool if they had a hobbies

558872280898207744,Saliva,100,Yeah_ that's what popped into my mind_ does sound like something that would fit into the server well
558872629646458882,Saliva,50,Ay bud_ I think I may hop off and think a bit more

559012702987485188,Owen,953,So there's this girl in my grade_ I'm pretty confident she's got feelings for me. A quote of mine is her finsta bio if that means anything. Before she just started sending generic streaks she and I would be her streaks often. Today for my birthday she tried to get the our Spanish class to sing Happy birthday_ she wrote "Feliz Cumpleaños Ernesto (my fake name for Spanish class)!" With a cool design and she based the Spanish project we were working on at the time on my birthday party. She was the only person to actually have a birthday spam for me (I had many people post hbd to me but each just one pic) and she seems to trust me (she has told me some personal stuff that might sound pretty nasty so I won't say it unless asked). She is single as well_ but she recently rejected another guy_ even though he was a senior. I hope she's got feelings for me_ but I've been told it is probably just friendly affection which would make sense but not sure

I told him it wasn't an isolated incident_ because she has done the same with other people before. A lot happened_ but now he has the proof he needs to make his decision.
559045091491315734,owetre18,149,I knew they were going out_ because I'm the one who told her to date him_ because she'd never date me due to me having a girlfriend I was happy with.

560606595403481108,josh37,27,On my way home from the bar
560620720330244108,ItsPhezz,95,i know you don't like me and everything_ which plenty of people on this server don't_ but yeah.
560621057778909184,Owen,272,So I bought the iPhone which is also my first iPhoneNLalready enjoying it better than my other phoneNLThat's not saying that it's better than Samsung though_ Samsung over all but I'm too poor for that (bought this iPhone 6 with a charger_ case_ and screen protector for $85)
560621186749431818,ItsPhezz,53,neat.  iPhone is ok i guess.  i prefer android phones
560621444195811348,SharpesTheShot,136,Usually self sacrifice isnt a looked at way to go out and many people have some sort of self preservation going on <@204813531525283841>
560621817040207882,SharpesTheShot,82,iPhones are good but I'm gonna go with Androids being better <@451547375442460672>
560621981427564569,ItsPhezz,327,Yeah I know I debated that in <#278625925170462720> the other day.  Most people say they'll be hero's but won't be.  I however will be because I already wanna die so it's like no loss to me.  And if I win I'll save someone's life which will give me a cool ego boost and hide the depression for a few days  <@365323228530343940>
560622330372423690,SharpesTheShot,116,Yeah I get that going out as a hero but there are high chances that the flight instinct will kick in and you'll flee
560622983782072321,[KazooBoy]GillMan,161,<@204813531525283841> it's not that I don't like you. It's that you come here time and time again say you are happy dying and then disregard anything anyone says
560623206445219841,[KazooBoy]GillMan,50,It doesn't feel good to have your advice pissed on
560623596402114560,SharpesTheShot,27,It dont feel good Mr. Stark
560623636835205121,[KazooBoy]GillMan,9,What's up
560623683681648653,SharpesTheShot,22,Not much I just around
560623809313505281,SharpesTheShot,4,Hbu?
560623964469198878,[KazooBoy]GillMan,27,Not good to be quite honest
560623975949008916,[KazooBoy]GillMan,11,I fucked up

560624786192203787,SharpesTheShot,21,<@370753319775502346>
560624902642597900,[KazooBoy]GillMan,68,I'm not getting a job and now my friend is angry that I'm openly sad

560625411214802944,Commodore Alaska,6,Thanks
560625441300545547,SharpesTheShot,7,Anytime
560626091102961664,ItsPhezz,495,<@!370753319775502346> i'm not pissing on anyones advice.  i'm saying that i'd be happy if i was killed.  Depression is permanent.  it's not going away_ i'm always gonna want to die on some level.  Plus when you reach my level where your so desperate for friendship and attention that you basically obsess over it everytime you don't have it you feel so hopeless.NLNLI hate being by myself_ i hate sitting in my room being alone.  i wanna talk to people and hangout and leave the house but i can't
560626128880926721,ItsPhezz,76,1) because i can't drive yetNL2) because i don't have friends to hangout with
560626572067864596,SharpesTheShot,138,Being able to drive isnt really going to change anything because then you need a jobNL1) For gasNL2) FoodNL3) Insurance <@204813531525283841>
560626604649349127,SharpesTheShot,15,It's over rated
560626673775542303,ItsPhezz,37,*that's what i have my parents for* 😎
560626726313525248,ItsPhezz,79,although I do wanna work.  i really like the idea of working and getting a job.
560626750728568838,ItsPhezz,48,i wanna be part of the machine_ to feel imporant
560626796094160944,ItsPhezz,75,to feel like i matter_ that my presence is adding anything to the situation
560627082447683595,SharpesTheShot,98,It depends on the job cause you could get one you like or one that makes you want to die even more
560627234793324555,ItsPhezz,118,it doesn't matter what i'm doing as long as NL1) theres other humans around meNLand NL2) I'm doing labor and getting paid
560627266632155147,ItsPhezz,63,like i said... i cannot be alone.  i need to be doing something
560627504294002688,SharpesTheShot,156,Yeah I get that but there are time where you'll be alone for shifts and some where you don't do anything or theres a delay and you dont get paid for a while
560627675790704642,ItsPhezz,148,perhaps...NLNLhowever i also do believe that driving will help me because i can just drive to the city or make friends by hanging out in public areas.
560627704534401027,ItsPhezz,39,go to places i like_ explore new places
560627727280111636,ItsPhezz,53,drive to my grandparents house to hangout with family
560627933568303104,SharpesTheShot,101,If you think that just hanging out in a public place will get you friends I'm sorry to say your wrong
560628023947427870,SharpesTheShot,42,But driving a cool and sometimes overrated
560628072219672586,ItsPhezz,109,i don't mean loitering in a park.  i mean like going to a card shop or signing up for those Public D&D games.
560628108953387027,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,23,The right places it can
560628121720848394,ItsPhezz,37,finding people with common interests.
560628695908352020,ItsPhezz,112,but yeah that's my plan... drive to Thriftshops_ videostores_ card shops... uhhh... where else do nerds hangout?
560628722399445022,taylor,9,join club
560628761062670379,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,11,LAN centers

560629027468214272,taylor,52,lmao i just go there and joke around the entire time
560629129754705941,taylor,113,honestly i just wore an anime shirt once to school and i talk to people you'd never assume you'd have interest in
560629147718909953,ItsPhezz,57,<@!150126670894989312> do internet cafes even still exist
560629229679673394,ItsPhezz,119,<@329457933677101067> i'm thinking about buying a Mob shirt and it's the "Searching for God" flyer from the helmet cult
560629259266424843,ItsPhezz,64,cause i liked the design and stuff_ its a nice reference i think
560629438547755031,taylor,21,lmao i liked that one

560629619804602388,ItsPhezz,39,so theres a pretty good amount of stuff

560629714629296128,ItsPhezz,67,i just can't drive so i'm trapped in my house for a few more months

560650669846167553,kermitjoinsthekremlin,4,same
560650703996190740,Justaharpy,61,Meds aren't risky unless you tried to kill yourself with them
560650712112168970,kermitjoinsthekremlin,45,i hate the lack of control i associate w meds
560650736917282826,Gamzee,23,meds are risky actually
560650749785276416,Gamzee,26,depending on what you take
560650755393191986,kermitjoinsthekremlin,35,i mean im not doing anything myself
560650764272402460,Justaharpy,9,And still
560650767309209622,Gamzee,29,cause the side effects n shit
560650777455230999,kermitjoinsthekremlin,4,yeah
560650796262359042,Justaharpy,4,Yeah
560650813677109274,kermitjoinsthekremlin,20,it causes dependency
560650829581778956,Gamzee,78,a lot of anti depressants have the side effect that it could make things worse
560650856018477077,kermitjoinsthekremlin,39,which doesnt quite help in the long run
560650870929489922,Gamzee,33,more suicidal thoughts/tendancies

560651215617392651,Gamzee,17,it's still a risk
560651248672440321,Gamzee,27,plus there's the fucking uh
560651259376304130,Gamzee,20,what are they called
560651271703494669,Gamzee,18,withdrawl symptoms
560651285624389662,kermitjoinsthekremlin,3,yea
560651290468679680,Justaharpy,133,It did happen to one anti depressant but the FDA was playing and making everything slap increased suicide risk on all antidepressants
560651320474861568,kermitjoinsthekremlin,21,once again dependency
560651365638995980,Gamzee,27,but they can work sometimes

560982023045382165,Victotum,210,Acne is caused by a bacteria. Therefore pop it helps to extract the bacteria. With the right tools and therefore you apply an antibiotic. It can be a solution or you can take it as pills and avoid popping them.
560982122509107221,/u/ThisIsHeath,39,but if you pop you can cause acne scars
560982291267059762,nick34223,91,Acne goes away after bout a week if you leave it alone and if you get some sun to dry it up
