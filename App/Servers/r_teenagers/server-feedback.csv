558113084040806420,Rodentman87,17,Wholesome channel
558465862059950090,Altii,96,Can we get the user limits on the quiet channels lowered back to 4_5_6? Or maybe do 4_6_8 intead
558465953650835458,Altii,30,I'd even be fine with a 2 or 3
558466000362668033,Altii,24,actually 1 works too tbh
558765335075880967,Google Home,70,Yall why is :sent: goneNLAm I tripping tripping NLOr NLDid yall remove it
558767094666231828,Lunarch,133,<@!491246211601399808> it was removed after user feedback_ check <#207943081847160842> for more info. ~~also yeah bring it back tbh~~
558817788022751232,taylor (guanglai kangyi),118,are y’all ever doing anymore creative events like art ones and stuff? or maybe you have but ive missed out on them lol
558818018084519951,taylor (guanglai kangyi),69,i liked seeing all the creative art for the snoo when it was going on
558823158363455488,milkshakegf,72,I know I would like to and ARC pushes along events like that really well
558840627723239456,j_ames,81,Ok It’s been 3 minutes and Gus still hasn’t given me my own channel what the fuck
558866760246362112,Soz,42,yo i need a channel just for flexing stuff
558866825602007041,Altii,32,You mean <#287073734664257537> ?
558866845004988425,Soz,8,oh shoot
558868137320251403,Zack,55,The incredibles 2 says its at 12:45 am_ it should be PM
558870980454383631,Altii,63,(I still think quiet channels should be 4_6_8 instead of 5_6_7)
558872309725659168,Ice͛̅̈́arstorm,116,A channel for people's hobbies would be good. Art would probably have to be separate since there are so many artists
559001592779505674,jaybird,33,You should have him sign the form
560285397687468043,j_ames,68,I feel like people purposely posting porn should get 7 days or Perma
560285572481155096,j_ames,110,Especially in general channels and self_ not as much in memes_ but still ban people if they post porn in memes
560285941793685505,caro,74,Zero was banned before we had a mod meeting and officially change protocol
560285984139509790,caro,39,which is why there's a shorter ban time
560643743515017237,Lunarch,131,Reactions are now disabled in <#556961572287938582>_ and we don't allow them because most emotes are used for non serious purposes.
560644201688203264,Altii,167,It's unfortunate people can't use them seriously_ as giving a message the '+1' reaction is much more efficient than saying another message to express your agreement :(
