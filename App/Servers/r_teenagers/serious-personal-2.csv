And there's 10 things he doesn't want you to do or else you'll to to a burning place with a lake of fire until the end of eternity. But he loves you! ...And he needs money! He's all powerful_ but he can't handle money!"
558437124685168644,needle dick,150,all the pain an individual feels is before deathNLthe pain ur family and friends feel is much worse and will go on for much longer than the individuals
558437181413130288,Gamzee,109,i feel like a lot of religions were warped and twisted from their original meaning because of greed and power
558437242838712333,Gamzee,35,not saying they're true or naything
558437261469941771,kermitjoinsthekremlin,120,i think religion is an answer to  question we have but people are the ones handling these ideas so they become corrupted

558761815849304075,Splodinate,21,I know what it's like

558771214764736513,sloshy,679,i literally don‚Äôt understand myself anymoreNLNLi have no clue how for the last 2 days i felt like utter shit the only thing i could think about was cutting every single vein from my goddamn arm but then starting last night at 2230 or so i started feeling mostly fine with no stimulus NLNLlike obviously i still hate my own guts and feel lonely as hell and am still armed with the knowledge that literally no one likes me but the fat man sitting on my chest and the urge to chop up my arm are both mostly gone and i actually have some interesting in fun things againNLNLi‚Äôm not complaining by any means i‚Äôm just hella confusedNLNLthis shit is the reason i don‚Äôt take my emotions seriously
558771380502396938,Gamzee,32,sounds like metal af mood swings
558771609004015656,sloshy,11,makes sense
558771740826796046,Gamzee,66,they're annoying as fuck but you jsut gotta take them as they come
558771784376123427,Gamzee,50,it helped me to distract myself or listen to music
558771882870964225,Gamzee,67,sounds like you're in a bout of depression_ my dude_ you diagnosed?
558772657206853648,sloshy,2,no
558777768377057280,Sissan21,47,Sometimes I just feel invisible to other people
558777834437345294,IceWap,1,y
558778478539964426,Sissan21,218,Because there's always people who want to talk with my friends and I know it's because I isolate myself from tgebrest of my class but now that I'm making an effort to socialise more I notice when people don't notice me
558784308383318048,jaol,56,It's good that you're trying to socialize more at least.
558784756389773322,devildogdesouza,289,<@!371772127117967361> developing meaningful friendships and conversations come with time. There‚Äôs tons out there to interact and meet new people. Explore your interests_ seek new things_ new people and this summer is a great place to start. Meetup.com or maybe just hang out with friends.
558784844726009876,Sissan21,138,Yeah but it kinda hurts when you try to talk more with people and all the time you spent almost purposefully isolating yourself comes back
558784931577331724,devildogdesouza,99,But no matter what there are always people who value you and care about your feelings and interests
558784982605234176,Sissan21,70,<@276011064930336769> what I said isn't in regards to your message yet
558785349279547402,devildogdesouza,282,I know what it‚Äôs like to shut out from others_ I‚Äôve had times where I was in bed crying my eyes out and not moving unless to eat or shower and stuff and I didn‚Äôt talk to a soul. But I found out at least for myself I was happiest when I explored my interests and hung out with people
558785473284407326,devildogdesouza,93,Now I get it_ I‚Äôm introverted_ people aren‚Äôt my thing_ I‚Äôm not the best at that kind of stuff
558785536962330655,devildogdesouza,51,But close friends make such a difference in my life
558785895105560596,Sissan21,468,<@276011064930336769> Thank you for reminding myself that people like my friends or family care because I know it it's just that I forget sometimes. Also next year since I'll start University so I'll have to try harder to make friends or else I'll isolate myself again and don't even have friends to go back to. Also exploring one's interests is something I've never done so I might join club on things that interests me because I can always make friends out of school
558786326280011776,Sissan21,212,And the problem I have with my current friends is that sometimes I don't even feel close to them because we like different things but I still have my older brother to keep me company and push me to try new things
558786471398473748,devildogdesouza,222,<@!371772127117967361> take time to explore_ it‚Äôs all about what you like. The good part is no one is there to judge your thoughts and you can take things step by step and on your own terms. Like I said meetup.com is great
558786616554946590,devildogdesouza,102,Maybe if you like a certain sport you can find others to play or if you like games you can pursue that
558786795660116008,devildogdesouza,112,Maybe you‚Äôd like D&D. I urge you to find a dungeons and dragons group. If you like that kind of stuff of course.
558786910185586699,devildogdesouza,133,It‚Äôs helped me meet new friends and create lasting relationships with others because of the bond we‚Äôve had roleplaying and having fun
558786969337856050,Sissan21,78,Yeah D&D always seemed so cool to me but my friends aren't all that interested
558787150821326887,Sissan21,95,I've thought about joining online groups to play tabletop RPGs but never got around to doing it
558787472641884182,devildogdesouza,37,You could always start your own ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
558787613620961281,devildogdesouza,54,There are a lot of people who play_ are you in France?
558787702934339584,Sissan21,45,I'm in Paris so I'm sure there's a group near
558787790834499624,devildogdesouza,40,I know it‚Äôs popular among American teens
558787853308395520,devildogdesouza,38,But I‚Äôm sure in Paris you‚Äôll find some
558787936938622977,devildogdesouza,76,Just wasn‚Äôt sure if you lived on like a dairy farm in the French countryside
558788100294180876,Sissan21,156,Also I've just remembered that my father is friends with people who work at a tabletop games company so I'm sure there's event where they'd played RPG games
558788499671744527,Sissan21,31,Thanks for your help_ goodnight

558805035341971456,spifflicate_,522,ive been thinking and reminiscing lately. I remember when this big confession thing from my then-crush happened back in middle school_ and I've just been thinking about this one other guy a year older than me that I lead on during the time. I didn't mean for it to be hurtful but I can see why it would have. We were texting each other everyday and he was leading up to a song he wrote that he says was a surprise. And then the whole confession thing happened and i was freaking out_ and I just completely disregarded him.
558822731467194368,nudd,26,Wait so u lead the guy on?
558827426982002698,ANuGgEt,3,sup
558831611169472534,Owen,825,So there's this girl in my grade_ I'm pretty confident she's got feelings for me. A quote of mine is her finsta bio if that means anything. Before she just started sending generic streaks she and I would be her streaks often. Today for my birthday she tried to get the our Spanish class to sing Happy birthday_ she wrote "Feliz Cumplea√±os Ernesto (my fake name for Spanish class)!" With a cool design and she based the Spanish project we were working on at the time on my birthday party. She was the only person to actually have a birthday spam for me (I had many people post hbd to me but each just one pic) and she seems to trust me (she has told me some personal stuff that might sound pretty nasty so I won't say it unless asked). She is single as well_ but she recently rejected another guy_ even though he was a senior.
558832169750102035,Owen,39,Wondering if I should make moves or noy
558832174896381952,Owen,3,Not
558832712874590218,J√™√ê√Øk√ØlL√™r,365,She just seems like a nice person_ doesn't mean they like youNLAnd if she's rejected someone before it really doesn't matter_ could be for any number of reasons {one of which is she doesnt want to date}NLAs to the trusting thing_ it really doesn't mean as much as it would seemNLNot trying to put you down or anythingNLThen again_ they might like you /shrugNL'make moves
558832741085478953,J√™√ê√Øk√ØlL√™r,32,oh shi* i didnt mean to post yet

558833650398134282,Owen,56,Friendly affection probably describes her actions better
558834169606701056,Confused Chubchar,137,really i would kinda just show the best of you and what you can give for a bit around her and see how it goes since  you guys talk right?
558834237235658782,Confused Chubchar,87,and anyways whenever you feel as the right time you can try asking her out to something
558834238523179009,Owen,4,Yeah
558834345209626634,Confused Chubchar,123,if you get put down i mean at least shes still a hell of a person to be around whether or not you're dating or just friends

558858632486322176,Saliva,386,All I want is to know where I went wrong. I look back on my life and things were not too bad. I was happier then_ I was better at making friends/wasn't losing people_ and it's almost like I've given up on things. I don't want to end up throwing away an potential I could have but at the same time it feels like it's all already gone. I don't even know what I need though_ it's kinda sad

558867761623859211,ThatKid,116,<@531709729072873482> you should figure out what the most important things are to you and how youve given up on them

559088527413870633,myrthe,157,I don't know_ we were together for quite a long time_ but she broke up with me without any warnings or anything and I think that also plays a part in this :/

559089522508431360,devildogdesouza,304,Oh darn. Yeah that is very very soon. Well it‚Äôs important to think about what *you* want in this situation. If you think that she‚Äôd take you back maybe you guys can work something out. But if it just wasn‚Äôt working out or there is little holding it all up_ it might be best to let things live in the past
559089664414318637,myrthe,77,she made it very clear we'd never be a thing again_ and I'm trying to move on
559089809864392714,devildogdesouza,259,But it‚Äôs important to develop yourself as a better person. Try not to let things bring you down. Summer is almost here and you‚Äôll be able to do so much_ you‚Äôll find your happiness. It is hard I know_ but you‚Äôll be happy without her I promise_ it‚Äôll get better
559090197120286721,devildogdesouza,182,Explore your interests_ find a new hobby_ find a job_ spend time with friends_ exercise_ grab some buddies and play badminton or something lol. You‚Äôll make it through I promise. üòÉ ‚ù§Ô∏è

559101002167484416,IceÕõÃÖÕÑarstorm,89,it would be good if servers had an option to have custom avatars in addition to nicknames
