560606594606301199,Scrub,31,LN or manga is prob even better
560627753938976768,yoba,27,that's like the whole month
560954620403384321,Knox,63,It's only recently that he has been able to be on the offense_.
560954722480291850,EbolaSpreadn247,77,that doesnt explain why the freaking weapons deal less damage than the shield
560954738409996323,Knox,4,Also
560954945608744961,Knox,243,It's mostly because of the ability he used. It seems to be linked with the Rage Shield so far_ I am unsure - but it *is* a move that has literally never been seen before_ so the rage shield could just be a fuck ton stronger than their weapons.
560955019222843423,Knox,132,Though_ the boss they were fighting and that he used Iron Maiden on_ was still alive even after it. It was just really_ really weak.
560955053494501406,EbolaSpreadn247,16,its still absurd
560955195597783059,EbolaSpreadn247,31,Raphtalia isnt jackshit anymore
560955250815795210,Knox,47,Because she hasn't gotten her class upgrade yet
560955286928490496,JIN,3,Hey
560955327760171010,JIN,20,What we talking bout
560955389362044928,EbolaSpreadn247,41,The shield being the most powerful weapon
560955452289056788,EbolaSpreadn247,47,Can't the shield hero ALSO get a class upgrade?
560955483746336792,Knox,10,I think so
560955500720685056,Knox,23,I don't remember though
560955512301158402,JIN,17,What game is this
560955567951314955,JIN,9,Oh ok nvm
560955574666133504,Knox,40,The rage shield could be REALLY powerful
560955584715816960,Knox,22,We just don't know yet
560955651556114433,Knox,115,There is no true way to gauge it_ at least against other heroes_ because their weapons are null against each other.
560955689363832842,JIN,31,The rage shield seems really op
560955708422619176,JIN,5,To me
560955767436345344,Knox,66,It gets stronger the more rage he has I assume_ and he has *a lot*
560955782016008202,Knox,36,From all the shit that has happened.
560955794279890975,EbolaSpreadn247,58,the shield ever being able to deal damage annoys me deeply
560955813754306581,yoba,84,"their weapons are null against each other" - wait_ but he did fight spear guy twice
560958014496964638,ReaperDrake27,30,it'd make sense if you know it
560958025289170964,Knox,392,But_ let's say I have a stat that tells me me how much damage I can withstand defense wise. Let's say this stat is at 85 or 90%. When I take a hit_ I take a little HP damage but retain my stance when I do. Aka Poise. So_ I can keep blocking while taking HP damage_ but eventually I'll break at some point_ because poise doesn't last forever. I would imagine it's like that for the shield hero
560962390301081637,yoba,45,but maybe they just passed out from anxiety /
560962507414437908,yoba,24,'aaaa we gonna die' drop
560962606752595988,ReaperDrake27,5,maybe
560962859065016331,yoba,7,ah 6:20
560962895400140800,yoba,16,she hits his arm
