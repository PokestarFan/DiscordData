560954620403384321,Knox,63,It's only recently that he has been able to be on the offense_.
560954722480291850,EbolaSpreadn247,77,that doesnt explain why the freaking weapons deal less damage than the shield
560954738409996323,Knox,4,Also
560954945608744961,Knox,243,It's mostly because of the ability he used. It seems to be linked with the Rage Shield so far_ I am unsure - but it *is* a move that has literally never been seen before_ so the rage shield could just be a fuck ton stronger than their weapons.
560955019222843423,Knox,132,Though_ the boss they were fighting and that he used Iron Maiden on_ was still alive even after it. It was just really_ really weak.
560955053494501406,EbolaSpreadn247,16,its still absurd
560955195597783059,EbolaSpreadn247,31,Raphtalia isnt jackshit anymore
