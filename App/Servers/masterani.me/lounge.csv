558460903159365647,wither,39,they just dont have coasties or marines
558460939314266143,wither,34,other than that they have the same
558460976337518601,Helsing,18,canadians are cuck
558461030833979413,Helsing,48,i fully understand why muricans make fun of them
558461050455064596,son,36,too bad all of us military is a meme
558461056272302092,Hitch,76,and our navy and army don't have their own aircraft so they use the airforce
558461086198661120,son,48,but apparently only the army in canada is a meme
558461180272967680,son,29,navy has most of our aircraft
558461196429164545,son,25,and army has enough money
558461208873926666,son,18,to fund everything
558461344232505354,son,50,and our marines use things thrown away by the army
558461486742372364,wither,39,army is like what? 2 million strong rn?
558461596049997824,404011xz,33,I hear airforce has the best food

558461802816471050,wither,49,airforce has the best living standards apparently
558461840691036160,Hitch,12,That it does
558461866225958912,404011xz,64,That's what I've heard from everybody who's been in the military
558461908882292776,404011xz,51,They love the airforce food if they get the chance.
558462107444707330,Hitch,67,the officer/NCO relationship is also very different in the airforce
558462203397931009,404011xz,16,It's consensual?
558462227808780328,404011xz,27,<:Kappa:230321280337969152>
558462370658385961,Hitch,134,Kinda a role reversal since its the officers (pilots navs ect) put their lives in the hands of the NCO's (techs_ mechanics_ logistics)
558462506792779806,404011xz,42,You assume everybody in the airforce flies

558790070375677953,(49,14,its pretty fun
558790088557854753,(49,12,and not like
558790096074309662,Honk!,12,U bought it?
558790142983405588,(49,36,no ive played like 3 hours of it tho
558790174717247520,(49,8,its neat
558790185215590431,(49,14,and satisfying
558790290895536158,Honk!,96,My only issue with it is that the sword fighting looks like it COULD get reptitive after a while
558790367529402388,(49,62,Yeah its the same stuff you have to do every fight pretty much
558790387947536408,Honk!,93,But I like the speed improvement in comparison to DS_ and the fire shit looks awesome as well
558790405706088449,(49,52,Except learn to dodge new attacks for new bosses etc
558790433199751218,Honk!,22,Ye I kinda figured lol
558790544940072962,(49,125,And thats what gives the game its difficulty i guess. Take like 3 hits_ youre dead_ meanwhile you have to land like a billion
558790591065096222,(49,24,Otherwise start all over
558790718781653012,(49,95,but it makes beating the bosses and stuff all the more satisfying so i guess its a good formula
558791029407350784,Honk!,28,That *does* sound kinda cool
558791048042643478,Honk!,27,I like challenges like that
558791085657161728,(49,25,https://imgur.com/bltsErk
558791125201059870,(49,45,the executions and stuff are really cinematic
558791141462638593,Honk!,67,Not "take one hit and your dead" but also not "take a million hits"
558791293661085736,(49,52,yeah its a good balance between skill and difficulty
558791546439204866,(49,82,What makes it cool is that  you cant really take  your time with the bosses at all
558791611333476412,(49,87,So you have to skillfully dodge and be on your toes while keeping up a flawless assault
558791682272002048,Lio,17,freaking spoilers

558819654366265360,Lio,347,In human readability_ it is at follows: NLwhile Condition is true{do: action} | If condition is true before the line starts_ the loop will start_ if condition is false it will just skip the loop. After 'do:action' is executed_ the program will check again if 'Condition is true'_ and if so_ do:action will be executed again until Condition is false

558820246522298378,ANIME,23,it gets u the main idea
558820288385515546,Desperate Insomniac,92,I basically need a tutor but nobody in my programming class knows what they are doing either
558820330735403019,Desperate Insomniac,24,They come to me for help
558820366823456788,ANIME,15,ask ur teacher?
558820457651109888,Desperate Insomniac,60,Last time I asked her for help she didn't respond back to me

558820554870882354,Lio,47,before the loop_ x = 10_ after the loop_ x = 20
558820845472972811,Lio,84,It just repeats X under condition Y_ until X changes something to out of condition Y
558820927174082561,Messier Code BK201,93,i found two decent vids about it as well_ both 7 mins or so. the dude makes some decent stuff

558823231067521026,Desperate Insomniac,558,Design a program that will display an inches –to-centimeters conversion table.  The smallest and largest number of inches in the table are input values.  Your table must give conversions in 6-inch intervals.   Treat the largest number of inches as a cap. That means that if the next inch value to be calculated (when counting by 6) is greater than the largest input_ then that next inch value is not converted and does not appear on the table. One inch is equivalent to 2.54 cm.  Display the output to 2 decimal places and right align both columns of output.

558841146646855694,Desperate Insomniac,42,so I needed to make inches = smallestinch?
558841158663536660,Lio,56,Is C even worth learning? <:damndude:272210113534623744>
558841178032832532,Z-Transform,12,hell yes....
558841202355470368,Z-Transform,33,how do you think your OS works? 😛
558841306340655104,Z-Transform,36,linux OS is by majority written in C
558841344794165289,Z-Transform,37,all embedded computing is primarily C
558841347377987599,Desperate Insomniac,57,and how come inches is <largestinch and not smallest inch
558841347705143296,Lio,30,Isn't C++ a better experiment?
558841364398342150,Lio,11,investment*
558841491821297685,Z-Transform,103,C++ is good to know but more complicated than C. C is actually simpler because it has way less features
558841540718624778,Z-Transform,22,C has no classes ..ect
558841567905841156,Z-Transform,35,so if ya know C++ ya know most of C
558841601192099842,Desperate Insomniac,58,I basically had it but I had a few key things flip flopped
558841665549369379,Desperate Insomniac,13,is there like
558841705063907343,Z-Transform,60,Desperate Insomniac_ you need to learn how to use a debugger
558841741172670485,Z-Transform,80,it lets you walk through your code line by line and see the values of everything
558841782553804820,Lio,4,Yeah
558841873251303445,Lio,59,It helps when you don't know where the error is coming from
558841905132339213,Desperate Insomniac,56,inches = smallest inch just doesn't make sense to me tho
558842185915695134,Desperate Insomniac,82,so the inches variable is a basically another variable to make the +6 thing happen
558842234989183022,Lio,83,Because it must start as the smallest inch_ and then walk up to LargestInch 6 by 6.
558842250927538177,Lio,5,^^yes
558842293457518624,Desperate Insomniac,80,because if smallestinch + 6 then there wouldn't be a smallest inch anymore right
558842321504829450,Desperate Insomniac,38,it would 6 more than the smallest inch
558842434075885606,Desperate Insomniac,88,so the inches is just so the smallest inch stays and the inches does the +6 thing for it
558842796530860052,Lio,26,I am tweaking a few things
558842949144936469,Desperate Insomniac,135,theres only one more thing on this question that needs done_ the output needs to be formatted like a chart kinda_ and idk how to do tha
558842956384043028,Z-Transform,240,that online compiler has a debugger. https://onlinegdb.com/Bk06nfQ_V NL1. Set a breakpoint at line 13NL2. Run debugNL3. You can step through each line of your code by hitting "Step Over"NL4. If its stalled_ its because you need to enter in data
558843041327087637,Z-Transform,55,^ you can see the variables change at each line of code
558843067055210506,Desperate Insomniac,66,like my teacher wants it_ Inches  number       centimeters numbers
558843132846800929,Desperate Insomniac,40,and then others ones below it as follows

558870111860293632,404011xz,106,I feel like learning to code in college is kind of shit. You're basically on your own to actually learn it
558870221306200074,incrobe,8,actually
558870244194779136,King_Flowers,33,and then dont let it happen again
558870260342587431,incrobe,54,uni is probably the best to learn practically anything
558870284388794369,incrobe,43,you have so many resources at your disposal

558870366324260864,King_Flowers,44,you have to be proactive about your learning
558870386402394123,404011xz,62,Also teachers have limited time. They cannot TEACH you to code
558870405037686785,Lio,34,Uni around here is free_ but still
558870405885067285,incrobe,8,they can
558870417071407146,incrobe,12,and they do?

558870520829837314,incrobe,6,i mean
558870535333871666,King_Flowers,109,and languages from my experiences my profs dont teach anything they just go over the how to do certain things

558870600794374144,Lio,110,Learning to code is lonesome. Everything else is either copypasting or inserting people's fixes into your code
558870611510689803,King_Flowers,30,and she says we're making this
558870639105277964,King_Flowers,41,and we sit down and code a thing with her
558870641537712128,404011xz,77,Then you should know it's not all light and fairytails like you're describing
558870655630573578,Keisukek Bakahashi,119,i love how people here are so retarded they thought i took the time to write the lyrics to shut the fuck up song myself
558870669920698398,King_Flowers,33,and she points out what does what
558870670738456598,incrobe,19,im not saying it is
558870702757773317,incrobe,58,im saying that there are so many resources that we can use
558870708982251530,King_Flowers,43,and then she assigns us team work sometimes
558870710001598484,incrobe,15,to learn things
558870739558727680,King_Flowers,40,but either way you need to read the book

558870823625162765,King_Flowers,22,in programming classes
558870854759481344,King_Flowers,30,is to go overstuff in the book

558870903556145172,King_Flowers,32,hence why they have office hours
