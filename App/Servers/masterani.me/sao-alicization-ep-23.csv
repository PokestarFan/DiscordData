559078426682851329,Estrada,16,Now Iâ€™m prepared
559078591741034496,Frawstey,554,1_4: It's anime_ how many times do people have to fucking say this_ STOP BRINGING REAL WORLD LOGIC INTO ANIMENL2: The close ups that were shown were mainly of when they were prepping their attack/talkingNL3: Yeah I was perplexed whenever I saw that scene_ it felt really offNL5. Again_ anime_ real life logic doesn't apply_ this scene is for showing kirito's observationNL6. This is subjective to be honest I enjoyed the anglesNL7. I assume they were watching Kirito and Fanatio fight in case of Fanatio being beat_ and that is when Eugeo caught them offguard
559078642043322370,Frawstey,35,also_ as for eugeo ||he stays dead|
