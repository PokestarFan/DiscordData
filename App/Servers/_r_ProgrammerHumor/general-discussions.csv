558110971907014678,PokestarFan,2,Hi
558111485776232468,gator,7,Hello 👋
558116477551509504,SirMonkeyFood,8,Yeah_ us
558429828970184706,gator,30,<@506768715409260555> shopify?
558438502388334608,Zombie,41,<@!247019307253366784> I don’t understand
558438605861683200,gator,8,Nvm then
558438657246101525,gator,52,Shopify has a program with the pay for tuition thing
558438900029194251,gator,54,Then it really depends on the company and the position
558438972599304193,gator,84,Like if you are just coming out of high school it most likely won't be too technical
558439048289583105,gator,27,And more about cultural fit
558439069592584192,gator,7,/resume
558440355738157074,Zombie,185,<@!247019307253366784> no it’s called a degree apprenticeship basically they pay for your degree but you work for them and they pay you a wage but you have to have qualifications for it
558440534591668255,gator,86,Yeh shopify is similar . You work for them for half a day and go to uni for half a day
558440662660546571,gator,28,Assuming degree is undergrad
558440892646817792,gator,46,Or do they give a degree without going to uni?
558440991040864276,gator,76,Assuming it's the uk thing that is what happens based on my Wikipedia search
558440995805593610,gator,4,Cool
558444133841109004,Zombie,153,<@!247019307253366784> yeah a few days a week at work and a few days a week at uni but you don’t have the debt it’s also a bachelors degree in some cases
558444219690385408,gator,6,Gotcha
558755087003025409,Reflxction v2.7,73,its nice until people start taking your work for free and for granted ;-;
558755139381362692,its_meow,3,yep
558755358122835969,Reflxction v2.7,65,i had that feeling when i was making private discord bots for fun
558755378536644610,Andresian,46,what did you make anyway <@126059512611340288>
558755390431690753,its_meow,48,also I get about 8 dms a week asking about stuff

558755478029729812,Andresian,32,<:disappoint:377126702024753158>
558755522803793922,its_meow,5,why 😞
558755661094322197,SnakePin,58,minecraft mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
558755740509143042,Stve,4,this
558755795743801345,Andresian,42,minecraft <:disappoint:377126702024753158>
558755817612902437,davidv7,15,minecraft @mods
558755822738341888,Delite,44,<@557006338459172874> is that a new account?
558755833878413338,its_meow,14,no minecraft ✅
558755853164085258,Delite,35,p sure you've been here for a while
558755865901924373,davidv7,24,never played a minecraft
558755871488999424,SnakePin,29,<@142242854167642122> tru dat
558755872935772161,Delite,35,but it says you just joined discord
558755935397347343,SnakePin,33,I used the nitro gift on this one
558756001696710656,Delite,31,switching accounts for 1 month?
558756029878501380,SnakePin,21,nah I deleted old acc
558756054222110721,Andresian,3,lol
558756076250726417,Delite,6,i mean
558756082772606996,Delite,12,its 10 bucks
558756106340532237,Reflxction v2.7,1,F
558756128721338390,its_meow,1,F
558756136468217901,Delite,1,F
558756159507660810,Andresian,43,well the 5 buck nitro is worth more now imo
558756267431297024,Andresian,66,im gonna switch to 5 because those games are a bit old and obscure
558756474046775326,ThonkyThonk,38,and most of them only support windoose
558756761637748736,SnakePin,11,oof windoze
558756770416164864,Andresian,10,if not all
558756874955259926,Reflxction v2.7,41,does anyone even play those discord games
558756887626121218,Delite,50,<@209913856368050177> yh the 10 tier isnt worth it
558757001388097558,Delite,71,i had em for 4 months for free because of the grandfathered nitro thing
558757016626266133,Delite,12,not worth it
558757414980157455,SnakePin,40,hack all the things_ drink all the booze
558757646040170496,Andresian,73,by hacking you mean uncommenting random shit in html and js of a webpage?
558758421457797327,SnakePin,46,zero through three_ we're in every single ring
558758458611073056,Reflxction v2.7,54,im a hacker i hacked the page to say my name!11!111!11
558758534918176768,Reflxction v2.7,12,e.Z security
558758552387452960,Reflxction v2.7,32,googel im waiting 4 u to hier me
558758698374397964,Andresian,61,wiki pedia says im president of united america  give me money
558758700370886656,Aurieh,92,except you are not in every single ring_ because there are rings more privileged than ring 0
558758849507622922,Reflxction v2.7,25,tonald prump says im cool
558758862065500160,Aurieh,70,the pile of shit that is the Intel management engine exists in ring -3
558758876577660928,Reflxction v2.7,19,i mean donald trump
558758943728599080,SnakePin,37,mfw no one gets the song reference :(
558759132212232216,Aurieh,32,oh I know that meme by dual core
558759155834421281,Reflxction v2.7,57,i thought it was another array joke <@557006338459172874>
558759184749822027,Reflxction v2.7,22,jk i couldnt relate xd
558759391059247113,SnakePin,118,<@115076505549144067> also is hardware a ring? I thought lowest ring is zero cause rings are only existent in software
558759408268607490,SnakePin,20,and cpu manages them
558759422571053094,SnakePin,14,me is hardware
558759436856983562,Aurieh,4,well
558759451335720960,Aurieh,22,ME is a cpu on its own
558759465906601995,SnakePin,27,different small chip in cpu
558759473246633985,SnakePin,6,yea Ik
558759489025605653,Aurieh,41,people refer to it as ring -3 because uhh
558759492813062167,Aurieh,7,reasons
558759508738834452,Aurieh,20,it isn't a real ring
558759569900306442,Aurieh,67,but it has full unrestricted access to everything running in ring 0
558759606273310780,Aurieh,15,so there's that
558759634186534915,Delite,46,<@115076505549144067> did you delete gewp yet?
558759647759302656,Andresian,174,epic programmer prank!NLenter any discord channel and say "tell me whats your favourite programming language and ill say who are you"NLand then reply "lazy asshole" to everyone
558759658022502401,Aurieh,6,oh_ no
558759675525595176,Delite,25,<:ree:498921309330341898>
558759719708131330,Aurieh,38,I'll eventually get around to doing it
558759793955700775,Delite,37,<:SteamAngryCreep:492129366533341194>
558759846019727390,Aurieh,30,what the heck is that emoticon
558759923811614730,Andresian,5,steam
558759936700710922,Aurieh,56,and why does my cursor change shape when I hover over it
558759961526665245,SnakePin,78,oof I tried to strip the me's firmware but apparently 9. gen cpus prevent that
558760010033790996,SnakePin,38,I had to use buspirate to reflash bios
558760033169440768,Aurieh,6,oh rip
558760050772934666,Aurieh,22,me_cleaner didnt work?
558760097447280641,SnakePin,48,yeah 9. gen cpus detect that and prevent booting
558760102258016367,SnakePin,8,it seems
558760160810762260,Aurieh,53,wow intel really loves pushing anti-consumer shit lol
558760208156065817,Delite,6,i mean
558760212652359700,Aurieh,62,not that amd is less guilty (they have their own thing) but eh
558760253458612284,Delite,45,that isn't too much of an anti consumer thing
558760395758895114,Aurieh,59,it depends how you define an "anti-consumer thing"_ I guess
558760480659734529,Aurieh,88,ME and the like are inherently evil and you should have the right to tell it to fuck off
558760525882720270,SnakePin,86,only thing I want is Libreboot for 9. gen cpus and It won't be ready in next 100 years
558760561580572684,Aurieh,7,oh lmao
558760566970122266,Aurieh,9,more like
558760571554627595,Aurieh,9,200 years
558760583131037698,Aurieh,7,no less
558760678328893441,Aurieh,42,there's a reason my main laptop is an X220
558760719462563840,Aurieh,32,can't libreboot but can coreboot
558760739167272982,Aurieh,15,and me_clean it
558760934185762826,SnakePin,53,yeah libreboot is coreboot with no proprietary parts?
558760950409199635,Aurieh,3,yep
558761076716732436,Aurieh,93,most coreboot builds (especially those for older thinkpads) are almost 90% free (as in libre)
558761164339806212,Aurieh,53,with a few proprietary drivers that can't be replaced
558761339108196372,SnakePin,44,imagine if intel made their shit open source
558761356095127555,Aurieh,126,but if you are okay with an even older machine_ core duo machines like the T60_ X60_ X200 and T400 are all fully librebootable
558761418724212750,SnakePin,71,but I think something about x86 agreement disallowed making open source
558761503243763732,Andresian,87,if intel was open sourced im 100% sure we would have like 2-3x slower intel cpus by now
558761566984470538,Andresian,40,both by exploits and shitty pull request
558761570470199306,Andresian,1,s
558761616775315479,Aurieh,32,open source != open contribution
558761636618305536,SnakePin,3,yes
558761652821164047,Andresian,26,well then only by exploits
558761683170885661,SnakePin,31,dude there are already exploits
558761704037548036,SnakePin,32,and fixes are making cpus slower
558761735830634517,Aurieh,70,I don't think making something FLOSS makes it inherently more insecure
558761738615390217,SnakePin,15,was it spectre?
558761748354826240,Andresian,40,yeah but that would speed up whole thing
558761774120173607,Aurieh,20,spectre and meltdown
558761796698374151,Aurieh,15,also a new meme
558761869297451020,Aurieh,21,that has no real name
558762051590160421,SnakePin,143,I can only remember how one of them exploits were working_ it was something about placing sigtrap right in mapped kernel memory security checks
558762108133703685,SnakePin,35,right before security check I think
558762421397880880,SnakePin,58,cause branch predictor executed code beyond security check
558762464507068416,SnakePin,37,maybe not execute but something other
558762489643270149,SnakePin,42,I dunno how branch prediction really works
558762894163050536,SnakePin,59,<@115076505549144067> what do u think about puri.sm laptops
558762970541457448,Aurieh,85,not bad_ but not really the best option when it comes to fully free hardware/software
558763036756934656,Aurieh,72,if you want something that Just Works_ then yeah their laptops are great
558763190331244571,SnakePin,52,how does it has i7 7500u as cpu and support coreboot
558763255137566746,SnakePin,61,I thought coreboot didn't support anything newer than haswell
558763911843938338,Aurieh,69,I'm pretty sure coreboot can handle quite a few of the "new" chipsets
558763983281324033,Aurieh,44,puri.sm people even contributed some patches
558764838676070415,nobody1089,51,years ago_ coreboot only started 2006-era computers
558764880795271183,nobody1089,28,has it caught up since then?
558765227995430922,Aurieh,6,oh yes
558765316147118083,Aurieh,42,mostly due to external funding and support
558765434535673856,SnakePin,61,is this correct https://coreboot.org/status/board-status.html
558765608142110720,Aurieh,31,that's the official source_ yes
558804449129136138,Abdul,68,https://gist.github.com/ahaseeb8305/62ec7c53298de539f721bcb4093cd3d3
558804477017325569,Abdul,32,Anyone mind doing a code review?
558804542355931148,Abdul,30,Just prioritizing cleaner code
558804557946421258,Abdul,21,Or at least trying to
558806484339654676,somebody,160,_looks_ well not like there's a lot to review_ of what's there_ imo it looks fine_ everything is nicely separated into little sections of related function calls
558807012863901713,Abdul,1,👍
558807114068393984,Abdul,27,Javafx is a pain in the ass
558808067555459076,somebody,84,this is probably bad practice_ but i'd import `import javafx.scene.shape.*;` instead
558808668083322910,Abdul,40,Ah i just use the IDE tool for importing
558808729001263144,Abdul,41,I guess we can't do ```import javafx.*```
558809177779208192,somebody,14,don't think so
558809369706496013,somebody,43,so it wouldn't import `javafx.scene.*;` etc
558809900650594315,Abdul,25,Yep doesnt work jus tried
558809980577251349,Abdul,29,Which isnt very user friendly
558810012911403019,Abdul,38,But hey we're talking about Java......
558810088693956635,somebody,26,nah it's got a good reason
558810159472967682,somebody,91,firstly everything would be super slow if you imported hundreds if not thousands of classes
558810268403105815,somebody,75,secondly you probably didn't want anything from the child namespaces anyway
558810361478774784,somebody,128,it might be a thing you want in a scripting language_ but definitely not java (btw_ scripting languages don't allow this either)
558810448451862540,Abdul,34,True can defn see speed decreasing
558825929388982302,emccue,52,In general you dont want to use any sort of import *
558826036184481802,emccue,59,it makes it harder to track where stuff actually comes from
558826329546686485,emccue,96,it would be nicer if you could say stuff like `import java.util.{ArrayList_ List_ Map_ HashMap}`
558826363147124746,emccue,15,but cest la vie
558836578491957250,Abdul,9,Yep_ true
558836654102806538,Abdul,23,PHP 7 has that actually
558839297562771497,Abdul,77,Although minor but it's annoying that intellij doesn't sort imports by length
558839374780039173,Abdul,84,So once I finish the class I just use a website for sorting by length and copy paste
558859353709477898,emccue,47,I don't see why sorting by length is a priority
558859420625403905,emccue,71,though I am sure you can configure the autoformatter somehow to do that
558865051235385344,Abdul,31,Totally not a priority just OCD
558865064699101195,Abdul,28,<:monkaS:524684619027578901>
558865476953047040,Abdul,112,<@242066553183404032> Just wondering for arrays is it considered a better practice to keep the var names plural?
558865550445510669,Abdul,36,Or I guess it depends on language's?
558867670787817473,emccue,99,For me_ when i name a collection of things it usually ends up that using plural describes it better
558867728166027287,emccue,41,but it all depends on what you are naming
558867793882120212,emccue,53,i wouldnt make a collection of cats and call it `cat`
558867812219617283,emccue,20,thats just confusing
558867981711704064,emccue,47,but if you are keeping some messages in a queue
558868150750543893,emccue,131,`messageQueue` works as a name since having the word queue implies both the direction data flows and the idea of possible plurality
559002036721680394,awsyoos,77,does anyone know like a simple ai program i can copy paste and run in python?
559012366801436682,ACBob,20,imagine using chrome
559012488931180556,awsyoos,22,you're using chrome rn
559012539644510250,ACBob,3,...
559012546330492928,awsyoos,37,because discord is a cut off chromium
559012551673774085,ACBob,6,OH GOD
559012607026266112,ACBob,51,WEll to browse the internet i use netscape explorer
559012652358172673,awsyoos,11,i use opera
559012699879505940,ACBob,4,nive
559016485964742657,ForkyFork,1,👍
559018218455433246,ACBob,56,doesn't firefox have support for some chrome extensions?
559019058272403456,ACBob,18,because fuck adobe
559019063200710666,ForkyFork,8,:pirate:
559019509277523968,ACBob,28,that is incredibly wholesome
559019525715132440,ACBob,9,thank you
559021072880500812,ACBob,4,yeah
559022319968845866,MemoryError,26,why is rust so complicated
559022361425477633,MemoryError,48,there are at least three ways of doing something
559022398628823070,modestas.ruksnaitis,370,In the case of Ant-Man and Thanos_ if you're not confident in drawing detailed anatomy_ just do enough detail for the characters to be recognisably_ say a bald head with radiator grille chin for Thanos and an Ant-Man mask_ stick both heads on some stickmen_ and the incongruity in detail just adds to the humour of the sketch. It's not laziness; it's a stylistic choice!
559022420330151938,MemoryError,25,and two "string" time wtf
559022737167745030,ACBob,4,yeah
559022753391444016,ACBob,27,i'll try that at some point
559022779194671127,modestas.ruksnaitis,91,Is it something like Haskell's byte string types_ with one being lazy and the other strict?
559041057438957578,emccue,101,`For example wrong path gone in prod_ thing run QA but Not on prod_ skipping some basic sanity check`
559042809202606100,emccue,48,and you should do as little "faking" as possible
559043704959139853,emccue,114,and there should be at least a warning on the PR if it drops at all so it can be discussed with your code reviewer
