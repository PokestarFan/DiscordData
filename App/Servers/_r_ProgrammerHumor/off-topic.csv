558850715766882315,kenndel,26,$160 winner take all prize
558850802677186560,kenndel,52,I actually have a 98% correct call average right now
559030458248200214,somebody,130,Really the main advantage Photoshop offers over other tools is Custom brushes and the like_ and AI(?)-based tools like the bandaid
559031304314945536,somebody,76,Hmm. I guess not custom brushes. A more flexible image format then_ possibly
559031445469921300,somebody,61,Or maybe they've just taken up the entire market from day one
559031466609213450,somebody,7,Like M$

559031508669825025,MemoryError,4,oops
559031582070013973,modestas.ruksnaitis,42,<@153146360705712128>_ I would suspect so.
559031792770875402,MemoryError,57,<@!315812499872022530> Here's my second attempt at thanos
559031860307427329,MemoryError,36,i used the blue eyes from the comics
559031885225918485,somebody,21,Thanks has blue eyes?
559031894012854287,somebody,2,Oh
559031948664766504,modestas.ruksnaitis,153,It probably is to do with the fact it *is* on the market and_ as such_ gets advertised so people know about it. GIMP and Linux_ as free software_ do not.
559031949767868447,somebody,15,Autocorrect pls
559031998447091751,modestas.ruksnaitis,41,<@467576889926483969>_ that is brilliant.

559032242865700884,modestas.ruksnaitis,110,If you're going for a comic_ then it's perfect. It has the two key ingredients: recognisability and silliness.
559032257017544736,somebody,117,<@315812499872022530> well PS definitely also has an edge over its competitors_ I'm just not sure how much of an edge
559032459371741216,somebody,79,I guess it's just good for photo manipulation like it was probably intended for
559032719284240400,modestas.ruksnaitis,229,Does it? While I'm no pro myself_ I read someone graphic designer's comment that both GIMP and PS have a similarly vast suite of high level tools but cover slightly different areas and_ as such_ he uses both depending on the job.
559033621701197834,MemoryError,88,how did this escalate from Thanos's ass to a discussion about proprietary vs open source
559034858085679104,ACBob,24,Open Source > Propietary
559038102761635855,MemoryError,18,oh lawd they typin
559038298320928788,modestas.ruksnaitis,246,To go back off our tangent_ I just want to say_ <@!242313388963659776> and <@467576889926483969>_ you have both shown yourselves to be talented artists_ for what my opinion's worth_ so next time you feel like drawing_ just go for it.NLPeace out. ‚òÆ

559038421822341130,MemoryError,25,i failed in Art at school
559038457318604840,MemoryError,5,twice
559038605692239893,modestas.ruksnaitis,76,There could be many reasons for that. Doesn't say anything about your skill.
559038655801327628,modestas.ruksnaitis,64,School courses have to follow a certain framework. Art does not.
559038686243848204,modestas.ruksnaitis,26,Never let it get you down.
