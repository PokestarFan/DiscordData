558111485776232468,gator,general-discussions,7,Hello 👋
558113319186071572,Redditcord,reddit-feed,0,
558116477551509504,SirMonkeyFood,general-discussions,8,Yeah_ us
558429828970184706,gator,general-discussions,30,<@506768715409260555> shopify?
558438502388334608,Zombie,general-discussions,41,<@!247019307253366784> I don’t understand
558438605861683200,gator,general-discussions,8,Nvm then
558438657246101525,gator,general-discussions,52,Shopify has a program with the pay for tuition thing
558438900029194251,gator,general-discussions,54,Then it really depends on the company and the position
558438972599304193,gator,general-discussions,84,Like if you are just coming out of high school it most likely won't be too technical
558439048289583105,gator,general-discussions,27,And more about cultural fit
558439069592584192,gator,general-discussions,7,/resume
558440355738157074,Zombie,general-discussions,185,<@!247019307253366784> no it’s called a degree apprenticeship basically they pay for your degree but you work for them and they pay you a wage but you have to have qualifications for it
558440534591668255,gator,general-discussions,86,Yeh shopify is similar . You work for them for half a day and go to uni for half a day
558440662660546571,gator,general-discussions,28,Assuming degree is undergrad
558440892646817792,gator,general-discussions,46,Or do they give a degree without going to uni?
558440991040864276,gator,general-discussions,76,Assuming it's the uk thing that is what happens based on my Wikipedia search
558440995805593610,gator,general-discussions,4,Cool
558444133841109004,Zombie,general-discussions,153,<@!247019307253366784> yeah a few days a week at work and a few days a week at uni but you don’t have the debt it’s also a bachelors degree in some cases
558444219690385408,gator,general-discussions,6,Gotcha

558756159507660810,Andresian,general-discussions,43,well the 5 buck nitro is worth more now imo
558756267431297024,Andresian,general-discussions,66,im gonna switch to 5 because those games are a bit old and obscure
558756377275924511,SnakePin,bot-spam,5,!help
558756415552880641,SnakePin,bot-spam,20,what happened to evo
558756474046775326,ThonkyThonk,general-discussions,38,and most of them only support windoose
558756761637748736,SnakePin,general-discussions,11,oof windoze
558756770416164864,Andresian,general-discussions,10,if not all
558756874955259926,Reflxction v2.7,general-discussions,41,does anyone even play those discord games
558756887626121218,Delite,general-discussions,50,<@209913856368050177> yh the 10 tier isnt worth it
558757001388097558,Delite,general-discussions,71,i had em for 4 months for free because of the grandfathered nitro thing
558757016626266133,Delite,general-discussions,12,not worth it
558757414980157455,SnakePin,general-discussions,40,hack all the things_ drink all the booze
558757646040170496,Andresian,general-discussions,73,by hacking you mean uncommenting random shit in html and js of a webpage?
558758132042694667,Redditcord,reddit-feed,0,
558758421457797327,SnakePin,general-discussions,46,zero through three_ we're in every single ring
558758458611073056,Reflxction v2.7,general-discussions,54,im a hacker i hacked the page to say my name!11!111!11
558758534918176768,Reflxction v2.7,general-discussions,12,e.Z security
558758552387452960,Reflxction v2.7,general-discussions,32,googel im waiting 4 u to hier me
558758698374397964,Andresian,general-discussions,61,wiki pedia says im president of united america  give me money
558758700370886656,Aurieh,general-discussions,92,except you are not in every single ring_ because there are rings more privileged than ring 0
558758849507622922,Reflxction v2.7,general-discussions,25,tonald prump says im cool
558758862065500160,Aurieh,general-discussions,70,the pile of shit that is the Intel management engine exists in ring -3
558758876577660928,Reflxction v2.7,general-discussions,19,i mean donald trump
558758943728599080,SnakePin,general-discussions,37,mfw no one gets the song reference :(
558759132212232216,Aurieh,general-discussions,32,oh I know that meme by dual core
558759155834421281,Reflxction v2.7,general-discussions,57,i thought it was another array joke <@557006338459172874>
558759184749822027,Reflxction v2.7,general-discussions,22,jk i couldnt relate xd
558759391059247113,SnakePin,general-discussions,118,<@115076505549144067> also is hardware a ring? I thought lowest ring is zero cause rings are only existent in software
558759408268607490,SnakePin,general-discussions,20,and cpu manages them
558759422571053094,SnakePin,general-discussions,14,me is hardware
558759436856983562,Aurieh,general-discussions,4,well
558759451335720960,Aurieh,general-discussions,22,ME is a cpu on its own
558759465906601995,SnakePin,general-discussions,27,different small chip in cpu
558759473246633985,SnakePin,general-discussions,6,yea Ik
558759489025605653,Aurieh,general-discussions,41,people refer to it as ring -3 because uhh
558759492813062167,Aurieh,general-discussions,7,reasons
558759508738834452,Aurieh,general-discussions,20,it isn't a real ring
558759569900306442,Aurieh,general-discussions,67,but it has full unrestricted access to everything running in ring 0
558759606273310780,Aurieh,general-discussions,15,so there's that
558759634186534915,Delite,general-discussions,46,<@115076505549144067> did you delete gewp yet?
558759647759302656,Andresian,general-discussions,174,epic programmer prank!NLenter any discord channel and say "tell me whats your favourite programming language and ill say who are you"NLand then reply "lazy asshole" to everyone
558759658022502401,Aurieh,general-discussions,6,oh_ no
558759675525595176,Delite,general-discussions,25,<:ree:498921309330341898>
558759719708131330,Aurieh,general-discussions,38,I'll eventually get around to doing it
558759793955700775,Delite,general-discussions,37,<:SteamAngryCreep:492129366533341194>
558759846019727390,Aurieh,general-discussions,30,what the heck is that emoticon
558759923811614730,Andresian,general-discussions,5,steam
558759936700710922,Aurieh,general-discussions,56,and why does my cursor change shape when I hover over it
558759961526665245,SnakePin,general-discussions,78,oof I tried to strip the me's firmware but apparently 9. gen cpus prevent that
558760010033790996,SnakePin,general-discussions,38,I had to use buspirate to reflash bios
558760033169440768,Aurieh,general-discussions,6,oh rip
558760050772934666,Aurieh,general-discussions,22,me_cleaner didnt work?
558760097447280641,SnakePin,general-discussions,48,yeah 9. gen cpus detect that and prevent booting
558760102258016367,SnakePin,general-discussions,8,it seems
558760160810762260,Aurieh,general-discussions,53,wow intel really loves pushing anti-consumer shit lol
558760208156065817,Delite,general-discussions,6,i mean
558760212652359700,Aurieh,general-discussions,62,not that amd is less guilty (they have their own thing) but eh
558760253458612284,Delite,general-discussions,45,that isn't too much of an anti consumer thing
558760395758895114,Aurieh,general-discussions,59,it depends how you define an "anti-consumer thing"_ I guess
558760480659734529,Aurieh,general-discussions,88,ME and the like are inherently evil and you should have the right to tell it to fuck off
558760525882720270,SnakePin,general-discussions,86,only thing I want is Libreboot for 9. gen cpus and It won't be ready in next 100 years
558760561580572684,Aurieh,general-discussions,7,oh lmao
558760566970122266,Aurieh,general-discussions,9,more like
558760571554627595,Aurieh,general-discussions,9,200 years
558760583131037698,Aurieh,general-discussions,7,no less
558760678328893441,Aurieh,general-discussions,42,there's a reason my main laptop is an X220
558760719462563840,Aurieh,general-discussions,32,can't libreboot but can coreboot
558760739167272982,Aurieh,general-discussions,15,and me_clean it
558760934185762826,SnakePin,general-discussions,53,yeah libreboot is coreboot with no proprietary parts?
558760950409199635,Aurieh,general-discussions,3,yep
558761076716732436,Aurieh,general-discussions,93,most coreboot builds (especially those for older thinkpads) are almost 90% free (as in libre)
558761164339806212,Aurieh,general-discussions,53,with a few proprietary drivers that can't be replaced
558761339108196372,SnakePin,general-discussions,44,imagine if intel made their shit open source
558761356095127555,Aurieh,general-discussions,126,but if you are okay with an even older machine_ core duo machines like the T60_ X60_ X200 and T400 are all fully librebootable
558761418724212750,SnakePin,general-discussions,71,but I think something about x86 agreement disallowed making open source
558761503243763732,Andresian,general-discussions,87,if intel was open sourced im 100% sure we would have like 2-3x slower intel cpus by now
558761566984470538,Andresian,general-discussions,40,both by exploits and shitty pull request
558761570470199306,Andresian,general-discussions,1,s
558761616775315479,Aurieh,general-discussions,32,open source != open contribution
558761636618305536,SnakePin,general-discussions,3,yes
558761652821164047,Andresian,general-discussions,26,well then only by exploits
558761683170885661,SnakePin,general-discussions,31,dude there are already exploits
558761704037548036,SnakePin,general-discussions,32,and fixes are making cpus slower
558761735830634517,Aurieh,general-discussions,70,I don't think making something FLOSS makes it inherently more insecure
558761738615390217,SnakePin,general-discussions,15,was it spectre?
558761748354826240,Andresian,general-discussions,40,yeah but that would speed up whole thing
558761774120173607,Aurieh,general-discussions,20,spectre and meltdown
558761796698374151,Aurieh,general-discussions,15,also a new meme
558761869297451020,Aurieh,general-discussions,21,that has no real name
558762051590160421,SnakePin,general-discussions,143,I can only remember how one of them exploits were working_ it was something about placing sigtrap right in mapped kernel memory security checks
558762108133703685,SnakePin,general-discussions,35,right before security check I think
558762421397880880,SnakePin,general-discussions,58,cause branch predictor executed code beyond security check
558762464507068416,SnakePin,general-discussions,37,maybe not execute but something other
558762489643270149,SnakePin,general-discussions,42,I dunno how branch prediction really works
558762894163050536,SnakePin,general-discussions,59,<@115076505549144067> what do u think about puri.sm laptops
558762970541457448,Aurieh,general-discussions,85,not bad_ but not really the best option when it comes to fully free hardware/software
558763036756934656,Aurieh,general-discussions,72,if you want something that Just Works_ then yeah their laptops are great
558763190331244571,SnakePin,general-discussions,52,how does it has i7 7500u as cpu and support coreboot
558763255137566746,SnakePin,general-discussions,61,I thought coreboot didn't support anything newer than haswell
558763612718628864,Andresian,media,23,excuse me what the fuck
558763625037299733,Andresian,media,13,who made this
558763911843938338,Aurieh,general-discussions,69,I'm pretty sure coreboot can handle quite a few of the "new" chipsets
558763983281324033,Aurieh,general-discussions,44,puri.sm people even contributed some patches
558764838676070415,nobody1089,general-discussions,51,years ago_ coreboot only started 2006-era computers
558764880795271183,nobody1089,general-discussions,28,has it caught up since then?
558765227995430922,Aurieh,general-discussions,6,oh yes
558765316147118083,Aurieh,general-discussions,42,mostly due to external funding and support
558765434535673856,SnakePin,general-discussions,61,is this correct https://coreboot.org/status/board-status.html
558765533692952610,Zombie_Pigdragon,media,6,nodeOS
558765608142110720,Aurieh,general-discussions,31,that's the official source_ yes
558766911685525525,SnakePin,media,95,At least the linux has spears and can do hunting_ nodeos guy can only make shit memes like this

558804477017325569,Abdul,general-discussions,32,Anyone mind doing a code review?
558804542355931148,Abdul,general-discussions,30,Just prioritizing cleaner code
558804557946421258,Abdul,general-discussions,21,Or at least trying to

558806484339654676,somebody,general-discussions,160,_looks_ well not like there's a lot to review_ of what's there_ imo it looks fine_ everything is nicely separated into little sections of related function calls
558807012863901713,Abdul,general-discussions,1,👍
558807114068393984,Abdul,general-discussions,27,Javafx is a pain in the ass
558808067555459076,somebody,general-discussions,84,this is probably bad practice_ but i'd import `import javafx.scene.shape.*;` instead
558808668083322910,Abdul,general-discussions,40,Ah i just use the IDE tool for importing
558808729001263144,Abdul,general-discussions,41,I guess we can't do ```import javafx.*```
558809177779208192,somebody,general-discussions,14,don't think so
558809369706496013,somebody,general-discussions,43,so it wouldn't import `javafx.scene.*;` etc
558809900650594315,Abdul,general-discussions,25,Yep doesnt work jus tried
558809980577251349,Abdul,general-discussions,29,Which isnt very user friendly
558810012911403019,Abdul,general-discussions,38,But hey we're talking about Java......
558810088693956635,somebody,general-discussions,26,nah it's got a good reason
558810159472967682,somebody,general-discussions,91,firstly everything would be super slow if you imported hundreds if not thousands of classes
558810268403105815,somebody,general-discussions,75,secondly you probably didn't want anything from the child namespaces anyway
558810361478774784,somebody,general-discussions,128,it might be a thing you want in a scripting language_ but definitely not java (btw_ scripting languages don't allow this either)
558810448451862540,Abdul,general-discussions,34,True can defn see speed decreasing
558811658881990668,bread,programming,138,<@403919257873678348> sometimes_ just to confuse my business partner_ I write `while (x = 8) {` because it comes out as true until broken.
558811728809426957,bread,programming,29,I get frequent texts about it
558811822719762452,somebody,programming,35,<@314205761846902788> what language
558812679829979136,bread,programming,20,Mostly in our Python
558813499862810634,bread,programming,104,and in our Java_ but that's because anything that's not false or 0 returns true in the of statement IIRC
558813710404026369,Kyro,programming,23,You can't do it in Java
558813884392407080,bread,programming,7,I use 1
558813940218462239,bread,programming,38,since the assignment returns the value
558814007251697665,bread,programming,15,1 works as true
558814525076275200,somebody,programming,3,uhm
558814601651683369,somebody,programming,55,assignment expressions were introduced in python in 3.8
558814649332662279,somebody,programming,52,in Java 1 doesn't work as true <@314205761846902788>
558814716537864202,somebody,programming,51,in python_ yes. in Java_ it's not a `boolean` so no
558815116297240586,Kyro,programming,58,And I was using a language that doesn't even have booleans
558816040390492160,Kyro,programming,72,But because of Java I'm used to explicitly saying `x==0` instead of `!x`
558817301705785345,bread,programming,44,You right_ it's not in my Androi dcode_ my b
558817595894005808,bread,programming,30,It's in the C++ part of my JVM
558825929388982302,emccue,general-discussions,52,In general you dont want to use any sort of import *
558826036184481802,emccue,general-discussions,59,it makes it harder to track where stuff actually comes from
558826329546686485,emccue,general-discussions,96,it would be nicer if you could say stuff like `import java.util.{ArrayList_ List_ Map_ HashMap}`
558826363147124746,emccue,general-discussions,15,but cest la vie
558831809010597900,MemoryError,programming,41,is there a way to append to an array in C
558831836588146738,MemoryError,programming,16,not linked lists
558832006050611203,MemoryError,programming,88,i have a callback function which needs to add an item to an array every time it's called
558832055534878740,MemoryError,programming,33,i can't figure out how to do that
558832650949754900,emccue,programming,63,conceptually an array is not a good fit for continual appending
558832774342246411,emccue,programming,118,If you want to do an operation like that you would be best off writing or finding your own "ArrayList" kind of wrapper
558832996619255833,MemoryError,programming,61,is there a way to find the index of the last item in the list
558833043738198016,MemoryError,programming,6,array*
558833123811524638,emccue,programming,58,I think you don't quite understand what an array in c _is_
558833202815565825,emccue,programming,34,it is a fixed size block of memory
558833229780484148,emccue,programming,39,that you have a pointer to the start of
558833301725511700,emccue,programming,55,it is up to you to keep track of the size of that array
558833325943554078,emccue,programming,25,usually in a seperate int
558833389654769664,emccue,programming,69,because you only have the pointer to the start of the block of memory
558833485142556674,emccue,programming,95,nothing about that pointer can tell you how much memory ahead of that you are allowed to access
558833647302606849,emccue,programming,160,so if you keep the size of the array and the pointer to the start of the array held somewhere then the "index of the last item" is something you implicitly know
558834656754008073,emccue,programming,53,and I might be wrong when I say to store it in an int
558834705592483842,emccue,programming,40,it might be a `usize` or some other type
558834734483111948,emccue,programming,31,I am not super well versed in C
558834781337550857,emccue,programming,45,and I don't have classes that make me write C
558834845690757154,emccue,programming,28,so I have no desire to learn
558834869896085527,emccue,programming,14,rust 2019 baby
558835036468674580,MemoryError,programming,24,well i suppose im fucked
558835125572468737,MemoryError,programming,22,time to check out rust
558835870220812328,MemoryError,programming,68,if anyone can help me out with this i might consider going back to C
558836141651001375,emccue,programming,54,The type you are looking for in rust is probably `Vec`
558836246571384832,emccue,programming,72,can you share your problem and what you were thinking of for a solution?
558836578491957250,Abdul,general-discussions,9,Yep_ true
558836654102806538,Abdul,general-discussions,23,PHP 7 has that actually
558836968654503943,emccue,programming,64,I can maybe whip up a quick A/B of what it would be in C vs rust
558837496327307287,emccue,programming,65,Actually I am kinda bored so i could use the mindless distraction
558838364481126401,MemoryError,programming,218,I have a function which retrieves a few rows from a database and uses a callback function to individually process each row. The callback function is supposed to map the row's data to a structure and add it to an array.
558838506462380072,emccue,programming,46,is this for a class or for a personal project?
558838554839613452,MemoryError,programming,16,personal project
558838627145089044,emccue,programming,41,cool_ means you can use whatever you want
558838656161546302,emccue,programming,8,what db?
558838663736459271,MemoryError,programming,29,i'm experimenting with SQLite
558838685718675488,emccue,programming,6,gotcha
558839297562771497,Abdul,general-discussions,77,Although minor but it's annoying that intellij doesn't sort imports by length
558839374780039173,Abdul,general-discussions,84,So once I finish the class I just use a website for sorting by length and copy paste
558839798748676097,emccue,programming,27,any more details than that?
558839872333414411,MemoryError,programming,10,not really
558839938129461258,emccue,programming,43,do you have a schema you were messing with?
558839981297106959,emccue,programming,29,like_ the SQL you were using?
558840051308429322,MemoryError,programming,22,not sure what you mean
558840113631592458,emccue,programming,64,well if you are using sqlite you started off by creating a table
558840131813900289,emccue,programming,26,and then you inserted data
558840155457454092,MemoryError,programming,4,yeah
558840155767701514,emccue,programming,28,and now you want to query it
558840324198236171,emccue,programming,79,I want to stick to what you were doing so I don't have to think about sql today
558840689530765333,MemoryError,programming,407,```cNLvoid handle_entry(void *entries_ int argc_ char **argv_ char **column_name){NL  Entry entry;NL  strcpy(entry.title_ argv[1]);NL  strcpy(entry.content_ argv[2]);NL}NLNLvoid get_entries(){NL  sqlite3 *DB;NL  sqlite3_stmt *stmt;NL  char *sql = "SELECT * FROM Entries;";NL  Entry *entries[100];NL  sqlite3_open("entries.db"_ &DB);NL  sqlite3_exec(DB_ sql_ handle_entry_ entries_ 0);NL``` this is what i was trying to do
558840733889724437,emccue,programming,10,ahh gotcha
558840765682548756,emccue,programming,29,whats the schema for entries?
558840905038168064,MemoryError,programming,18,ID_ Title_ Content
558840963368484879,MemoryError,programming,80,```cNLtypedef struct Entry {NL  int ID;NL  char title;NL  char content;NL} Entry;NL```
558841081064587275,emccue,programming,67,thats good_ but i meant specifically the sql for creating the table
558841133334003723,emccue,programming,23,eh whatever I can do it
558841223897546752,emccue,programming,79,remember kids: If you try too hard to be lazy_ you are actually doing more work

559019525715132440,ACBob,general-discussions,9,thank you
559021072880500812,ACBob,general-discussions,4,yeah
559022319968845866,MemoryError,general-discussions,26,why is rust so complicated
559022361425477633,MemoryError,general-discussions,48,there are at least three ways of doing something
559022398628823070,modestas.ruksnaitis,general-discussions,370,In the case of Ant-Man and Thanos_ if you're not confident in drawing detailed anatomy_ just do enough detail for the characters to be recognisably_ say a bald head with radiator grille chin for Thanos and an Ant-Man mask_ stick both heads on some stickmen_ and the incongruity in detail just adds to the humour of the sketch. It's not laziness; it's a stylistic choice!
559022420330151938,MemoryError,general-discussions,25,and two "string" time wtf
559022737167745030,ACBob,general-discussions,4,yeah
559022753391444016,ACBob,general-discussions,27,i'll try that at some point
559022779194671127,modestas.ruksnaitis,general-discussions,91,Is it something like Haskell's byte string types_ with one being lazy and the other strict?
559030458248200214,somebody,off-topic,130,Really the main advantage Photoshop offers over other tools is Custom brushes and the like_ and AI(?)-based tools like the bandaid
559031304314945536,somebody,off-topic,76,Hmm. I guess not custom brushes. A more flexible image format then_ possibly
559031445469921300,somebody,off-topic,61,Or maybe they've just taken up the entire market from day one

559031860307427329,MemoryError,off-topic,36,i used the blue eyes from the comics
559031885225918485,somebody,off-topic,21,Thanks has blue eyes?
559031894012854287,somebody,off-topic,2,Oh
559031948664766504,modestas.ruksnaitis,off-topic,153,It probably is to do with the fact it *is* on the market and_ as such_ gets advertised so people know about it. GIMP and Linux_ as free software_ do not.
559031949767868447,somebody,off-topic,15,Autocorrect pls
559031998447091751,modestas.ruksnaitis,off-topic,41,<@467576889926483969>_ that is brilliant.

559032242865700884,modestas.ruksnaitis,off-topic,110,If you're going for a comic_ then it's perfect. It has the two key ingredients: recognisability and silliness.
559032257017544736,somebody,off-topic,117,<@315812499872022530> well PS definitely also has an edge over its competitors_ I'm just not sure how much of an edge
559032459371741216,somebody,off-topic,79,I guess it's just good for photo manipulation like it was probably intended for
559032719284240400,modestas.ruksnaitis,off-topic,229,Does it? While I'm no pro myself_ I read someone graphic designer's comment that both GIMP and PS have a similarly vast suite of high level tools but cover slightly different areas and_ as such_ he uses both depending on the job.
559033621701197834,MemoryError,off-topic,88,how did this escalate from Thanos's ass to a discussion about proprietary vs open source
559034858085679104,ACBob,off-topic,24,Open Source > Propietary
559038102761635855,MemoryError,off-topic,18,oh lawd they typin
