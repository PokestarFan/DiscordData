558830562400534538,fucculent,164,Have mods found any workarounds to spoilers on mobile? I understand the decision to revert back to custom format but I'm still stuck with fake hyperlinks on mobile.
558830830332542995,Geo☆1088,13,There is none
558830879007571989,Geo☆1088,62,Other than using an app that supports them or the desktop site
558832074975477780,fucculent,49,Any app suggestions for iOS without working tags?
558832340873510922,fucculent,164,It would be great if you could update a wiki as well with workarounds and app suggestions because it feels like mobile users are left in the dark with these changes
558835079682719793,Durinthal,40,I use Apollo and it supports both styles
558842387988873239,Geo☆1088,30,We listed examples in the post
