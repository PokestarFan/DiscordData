558764642680438795,Ratchet,60,I don't know if this is the right spot for PC technical help
558764724284817408,Ratchet,34,if it isn't I'll move it elsewhere
558764782878982154,Ratchet,78,long story short about a week and a half ago I got a "memory management" error
558764839946682375,Ratchet,51,spent about 2 hours trying to do all kinds of tests
558764855134257162,Ratchet,24,trying to find something
558764899241558056,Ratchet,72,and I found corrupted files that my PC managed to fix by itself I guess.
558764949598371851,Ratchet,94,I don't remember the exact things I used but I can dig it out and find it if anyone is curious
558765242184892435,Ratchet,307,I assumed this fixed the problem. The computer worked normally for about 4 days and that day I decided to shut the computer off and take it downstairs for cleaning because I figured it was due for a cleaning. Long story short as the computer was shutting down (literally mid shutdown) I got the error again.
558765290893082645,Ratchet,81,After I got it I went through all the same tests I did earlier and found nothing.
558765382861848576,Ratchet,67,went to the event viewer and found a critical 41 kernal power error
558765557147762698,Ratchet,195,it's been about a week since this happened but I've been afraid to do anything on this PC out of fear that it'll happen again. I've tried to replicate things somewhat but it hasn't happened next.
558765711326052352,Ratchet,133,the only intensive thing I was doing during that entire week was emulating a SNES game. CPU/GPU temps were normal things seemed fine.
558765738370924584,Ratchet,47,I'm just unsure if it was an insolated incident
558765759988236310,Ratchet,38,or if my power supply is going to shit
558766052805443615,Bernas,59,error 41 is just windows saying it didnt shut down properly
558766162935152667,Bernas,66,make a usb drive with memtest86 and test your ram sticks overnight
558766240684965908,Bernas,49,ideally do them one at a time for 2-3 passes eacg
558766246867370004,Bernas,4,each
558766442212884500,Ratchet,6,gotcha
558766479449915412,Ratchet,72,so the memory management error is what I should really be worrying about
558766516687077393,Ratchet,45,error 41 likely happened as a result of that?
558766620034727947,Bernas,72,ye error 41 is windows saying hey dude you didnt hit the shutdown button
558766638087012373,Bernas,4,iirc
558766784342261790,Ratchet,6,gotcha
558766872451874826,Ratchet,94,well I did most of the ram related testing that I can do via windows 10 so I assumed it's fine
558766989435469844,Ratchet,101,did windows memory diagnostic_ and there's another one I did via command prompt in administrator mode
558767118372569089,Bernas,124,memtest is the safest bet_ especially doing one at a time. could also be a OS thing in which case a clean wipe should fix it
558767328460800010,Ratchet,7,gotcha.
558767376502620160,Ratchet,80,I'll definitely do that if it happens again_ though it hasn't happened in a week
558767429367365632,Ratchet,51,unsure if that means I'm in the clear or not though
558767446161620992,Bernas,38,ye those problems are a bitch to.solve
558767500486246421,Ratchet,103,I've just been really paranoid to do any gaming on this_ out of fear that it would fry the power supply
558768020172963842,Bernas,24,nah dude_ keep on gaming
558768087789469697,Bernas,63,it will probably happen again but you wont do more damage to it
558768291150168077,Bernas,82,I'd only worry if it meant losing lots of progress in a game or work related stuff
558768335190228996,Bernas,46,in which case I'd probably try to fix it first
559063460126916608,Asuto,28,<:wakaru:530062795807391754>
559063484277719064,Asuto,34,yes. i definitely udnerstand this.
559071290179190804,Nokimemota,122,im lookng at the send MAil function_ and honestly i understood basically everything one can understand from such a snippet
