558756547543564289,Zaboru,126,i just had my first encounter with the || Giant Serpent where it tries to eat you || and I just kinda panic jumped off the map
558756569811255320,Zaboru,29,this game makes me very jumpy
558757251192586253,Lto,76,I have yet to find the ||serpent||_ but I did encounter ||its shedded skin||
558757930103603211,Birb,113,Well then_ having a literally one-shot attack with hitbox twice bigger than the weapon model is a giant cunt move
558757957001543692,Birb,32,classic fromsoftware experience.
558760913340203010,piippon,114,<@203992091095728129> boss ||wire granny was hella intense_ yeah|| goddamn the bosses have been so much fun so far
558762775095148555,Zaboru,260,anyone know if there's a drawback to enhancing attack power by || confronting memories of i assume main bosses? like with DS you could use boss souls to create weapons so I'm hesitant to just outright use this option in case I'd need them for something else ||
558762793558474763,Birb,165,||she was annoying as hell tbh_ her first phase could be whittled down in barely 30 seconds and then the second is just running away from illusions and butterflies||

558783745331560448,Sir Hatsley,15,is this #sekiro
558783761018388480,piippon,3,yes
558783913250783232,Sir Hatsley,34,i've never played thru a soulslike
558783933479649310,Sir Hatsley,27,and i probably dont want to
558783993181372446,piippon,7,why not
558784022692757536,piippon,38,some of the greatest games of all time
558784116934443028,Sir Hatsley,114,uhhh_ i watched my roomate play bloodbourne for a while and i didnt wanna deal with the unforgiving nature of them
558784264565686291,piippon,52,that just makes them so much more satisfying to beat
558784369192468490,piippon,79,start with the first dark souls_ it's arguably the slowest and easiest to learn
558784426071556108,Sir Hatsley,7,i could
558784429812744228,Sir Hatsley,3,but
558784435219070976,Protest,20,I hated Dark Souls 1
558784481138442244,Sir Hatsley,3,meh
558784501422227485,Protest,33,I think 3 is the best as an intro
558784599178739758,piippon,34,3 throws you right in the deep end
558784631235805210,piippon,44,I'd say the hardest first boss in the series
558784661539782666,Sir Hatsley,53,i think i broadly dislike the design behind the games
558784673401012254,Sir Hatsley,33,even if i dont think they are bad
558784759636164619,Protest,70,Yeah I don't think you should play these games if you're not into them
558784797925703702,Protest,62,And I guess I just picked 3 up easily_ 1 was super hard for me
558784858407567422,piippon,17,was 1 your first?
558784895443533854,Protest,35,Yeah_ I gave up pretty quick though
558784925638197249,piippon,47,the first souls you play is usually the hardest
558784995343204362,Protest,49,I don't think I made it more than halfway through
558785009377607705,piippon,3,sad
558785032186232842,Sir Hatsley,115,i also hated what i played of hollow knight and that shares the same general concepts of punishment and exploration
558785112867864577,piippon,99,having played all of em extensively (starting with 1) I think 1 is honestly the easiest of them all
558785144362631179,piippon,45,so easy to cheese too from a very early stage
558785202047156224,piippon,63,or not cheese_ but easy to get a super strong setup really fast
558785333924462595,piippon,87,and it's by far the slowest save for DeS_ but DeS has far longer and unforgiving levels
558785466007027744,Protest,20,Maybe I'm just weird
558785479927922708,Protest,9,¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
558785869989806090,Eaze,202,to me the bulls not so hard but every time i try to run there some dumb shit happens and i have to deaggro everything_ get him down to like half and then all of sudden i throw <:puke:480843554114240546>
558785929242869770,Eaze,24,the runback is the worst
558786093684883459,piippon,35,really? it's just one enemy to kill
558786174362189849,piippon,68,or two_ if you wanna stealth stab the first guy inside the boss room
558786369766293562,Eaze,90,if you kill the first guy the other 2 die most likely if you line up the bull and the guys
558786407896973359,piippon,4,yeah
558786408710537217,Eaze,52,but if you runback from the bonfire to the bull room
558786435373858827,Eaze,33,everything can chase you in there
558786457867649027,Eaze,19,but its mostly dogs
558786464209436675,piippon,20,never happened to me
558786511043035136,Eaze,52,ive aggroed dogs in there <:LULW:512188171900157952>
558786599870136323,piippon,97,stay on the roofs until just before the hammer dues and then just sprint along the righthand wall
558786640105963532,Eaze,15,thats what i do
558786641863376897,piippon,24,dogs shouldnt even aggro
558786650629734411,Eaze,17,its just annoying
558786711874961418,piippon,36,I actually like most of the runbacks
558786758767017994,piippon,53,makes me feel like a ninja flying across the rooftops
558787672429035561,Eaze,114,<:puke:480843554114240546> this time i aggroed a lancer in there and i got burn status <:puke3:411980213426061313>
558787930194182158,Eaze,77,nice just got the wartorn mob_ guess old guy ded <:monkaW:556199005005283368>
558790554381713458,Zaboru,285,for the runback to the bull you can just go right side up the wall where i think the first group of 2 enemies is and then grapple on top and drop down onto the 2 guys in front of the bull room_ that way those 2 and the guys in the bull room are the only ones you'll have to worry about
558791304063090688,Eaze,27,like i said thats what i do
558791536041656323,Zaboru,64,in that case the dogs and such shouldn't be following you though
558791582829248522,Zaboru,74,even if you had them on you before you'd lose them when you're grappled up
558792917179826204,Zaboru,150,i feel like i probably just explained it badly_ you can go across the right side and skip any chance of getting in the way of the hammer guys entirely
558796958718885908,Lto,107,trying to cheese some bosses by spamming the spinning skillNLalmost defeated the ||shinobi hunter|| that way
558797459548274702,piippon,189,I don't remember who was having trouble earlier with boss ||the spear dude at the tower from the prologue|| but I just found a way to get to that fight without aggroing a single other enemy
558797476295868446,piippon,23,so you can 1v1 in peace
558803918625439754,piippon,153,can I just say how motherfucking satisfying it is to fight a (mini)boss so many times you eventually learn to combo its entire posture bar down in one go
558805746498797579,Lto,140,another one bites the dust <:rikkaawe:324623075507175424> NLdefeated one mini boss_ I think it was a mini boss_ there was no fog close to him
558805929194160139,Lto,80,must have been a mini boss cause I was able to stealth kill one of his life bars
558806251790925834,piippon,100,so far the only real difference between "mini"bosses and bosses is that the latter give achievements
558806829107380229,piippon,235,I have a general tip about the combat btw if anyone wants_ realizing this made it really click with me finally: ||never stop getting in people's faces_ you have unlimited stamina for a reason_ keep relentlessly attacking all the time||
558807039829344256,piippon,139,||you can usually wail on them until they parry you_ at which point you can usually parry their counter and then keep comboing after that||
558808420254220288,Lto,54,ill keep that in mind for when i dont suck at parrying
558808589335265290,piippon,92,I've realized you *really* need to learn it if you want to be successful at anything_ really
558808746701094912,piippon,126,in souls it's a special move that makes some enemies far more effective and easier to beat_ but here it's absolutely essential
558832317171367956,Lto,77,just defeated the ||shinobi hunter||_ had to cheese him with the skill attack
