560600491785060372,darkgray,65,Pfft_ I'm sure there's a draft started for the next Thrones book.
560600594239324189,Nokimemota,24,what about Rithmatist 2?
560600688967680030,Maximus,15,Donâ€™t remind me
560600755090751489,Nokimemota,39,so far the only sanderson book i;veread
560600764536455169,Maximus,77,He says he has a plan for books 2_ 3_ and maybe 4_ but itâ€™s not a priority rn
560600837378932746,Maximus,27,Sanderson gets carried away
560600965498142720,Maximus,61,Like Skyward_ a failed idea that got rewritten into a trilogy
560601136327819270,Maximus,64,~~I just want more Cosmere even tho Skyward was freaking great~~
560601716484079626,Nokimemota,57,i need to be locked somewhere without internet for a week
560601747093979159,Nokimemota,33,that'll make me catch up on books
560601804824379392,Maximus,20,I know what you mean
560632234017685566,Mob,1,6
560955287385800717,xelivous,15,no it's fate go
560964722447351818,Roak,3,yes
560976870322208789,Homura,68,yeah i figured..took me close to 7 hours to finish the first episode
560976940849430528,Homura,18,been at it all day
560977811247071232,ricey_mess,72,Ep 2 is about as long from what I've been told I'm like half way through
560977974523068438,Homura,43,so yeah probably won't play ep 2 for a whie
560982758407536651,ricey_mess,75,The reason ep 2 is taking so long for me is a lot of it is flashbacks stuff
560983326576476181,ricey_mess,50,<@475040852553629706> did you do thr tea party btw
560983357958258708,ricey_mess,30,For after ep 1 but before ep 2
560998939659206665,Sen,45,I'm not sure it's 10 hours per episode at mot
560998987285659668,Sen,51,that would mean it would take 80 hours to finish it
560999052419006485,Sen,40,and I hear it's a 100 hour vn on average
