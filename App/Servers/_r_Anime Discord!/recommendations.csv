558434071462805505,Roak,74,discovery is one of my favorite albums ever and this was such a cool thing

558755060746813461,windup13ird,7,Thanks!
558755127599562773,ricey_mess,64,Also this isn't ecchi_ but it's a great romance and my fav manga
558755138542764035,ricey_mess,48,https://myanimelist.net/manga/46282/Chikan_Otoko
558755214929297438,Homura,25,isn't nozoki ana a hentai
558755245056851988,windup13ird,170,I had also thought of doing Black Clover which is a guilty pleasure read of mine_  but the beginning of the anime has some real pacing issues_ or at least is really slow.
558755312585408547,ricey_mess,55,Well close enough to it_ but they asked for super ecchi
558755439047737344,ricey_mess,26,Has romance throughout too
558755440377462784,windup13ird,224,Which is a shame because from what I see it speeds up a lot after the first arc or two.NLNLI had initially wanted to show a One Piece movie as that is my jam_ but theres a bit too much fanservice_ like Nami in Strong World ;_;
558755741649993728,ricey_mess,36,Daily Lives has no fan service in it
558755761233199105,Jean,8,Digimon?
558755765431697411,ricey_mess,18,Also it's funny af
558755821660536852,ScrewySqrl,65,slightly ecchi romance?NLhmm...Girls Bravo_ Tenchi Muyo_ Love Hina
558755866334068736,JakX,119,<@511249794325282818> I read Jimi was midara already and it was perfect for what I wanted_ is Nozoki ana  close to it ?
558755911578157060,windup13ird,84,Dont know enough about Lives to show tonight_ but I have it saved for later viewing.
558755975356743720,windup13ird,25,Since comedy is my thing.
558755976640069646,ricey_mess,68,Uhh it's longer but has like hella sex scenes  <@317955189313241098>
558756010374725662,ScrewySqrl,65,TEnchi and Love Hina are harems_ but most ecchi romance is harems
558756045560741898,JakX,28,<@511249794325282818> thanks
558756083200426018,Homura,14,dagashi kashi?
558756121830096907,ricey_mess,23,It's more ecchi I'd say
558756625998151680,ricey_mess,95,<@362067284002603009> it's tied for my too 3 fav comedies along with Hinamatsuri and Grand Blue
558756702846189601,ricey_mess,72,Idk if Hina counts as shounen but it's another great safe anime for kids
558756792633524245,ricey_mess,22,Really wholesome stuff
558756897277214733,Twat,26,Grand blue was interesting
558756906743627794,ricey_mess,65,And starts off with a dope fight scene (the only one in the show)
558756980592869394,Twat,38,Half the jokes didn't resonant with me
558757098150690827,Twat,41,But the rest I found really fucking funny
558757148541321216,ricey_mess,22,The manga is great btw
558757177519636503,ricey_mess,26,Funnier than the show even
558757214672650250,Twat,21,Yeah I read the manga
558757289088122880,Twat,65,I didn't find the running gag about them getting naked that funny
558757393463377970,Twat,69,Like it wasn't annoying other than the fact to seemed to take up time
558757474635874315,ricey_mess,29,Ah_ I thought it was funny af
558757827871637532,Twat,170,>most of cast gets naked NL>New character is shocked and starts freaking outNL>One of the female cast members says something along the lines of "I hate that I'm used to it"
558757916824305674,Twat,38,Now I can see how some find that funny
558758048638959628,Twat,83,But to me I just didn't get it because I could predict when it was going to come up
558762277017485312,windup13ird,95,Digimon I could roll with it if I can find it. The isekai premise makes it start pretty quickly
558762286462795796,windup13ird,100,Speaking of Digimon movie_ I did debate Summer Wars but I think it would be good for slightly older.
558815569617616896,Kaiki,77,What is better? Nana_ A place further than the universe_ or The tatami galaxy
558815733237153792,NuttyNutt,44,Nana doesn't have an ending_ so there's that
558816000938868746,Legend,34,Those are all very different shows
558816262676021249,Kaiki,19,ok nana is out then
558816473901039616,Legend,42,Doesn't make it not worth the watch though
558828973400915978,Durinthal,66,I like Nana more than the other two <:yuishrug:529569462207250433>
558830590346919936,SirPokerface,76,is mekakucity actors any good_ watching the first episode_ looks interesting
558832096538394625,EndlessEight,33,its one of my lowest ranked shows
558832112351051796,Homura,5,omege
558832128133955585,Homura,3,lul
558832152234688513,Homura,17,it's not terrible
558832171696259072,Homura,24,but not that good for me
558834997994192907,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),36,I'll always be another vote for nana
558835104357810176,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),96,<@90537621817655296> nana's anime ending is fine_ it's just the manga that doesnt have an ending
558835196229582858,ricey_mess,26,its good if you like drama
558853295754706955,ScrewySqrl,50,A place further ths the Univrse is better by miles
558853423143976961,ScrewySqrl,27,It's #3 on my all time best
558855483826503681,Rance,61,can someone recommend me some good anime related to communism
558855541120827392,Rance,42,struggle of working class against the rich
558858808307351552,ricey_mess,50,Is there a movie about like_ demon/monster hunters
558858828825755668,ricey_mess,22,with good fight scenes
558858913592639488,Rance,24,Hellsing Ultimate counts
558858934849634334,Rance,19,but its not a movie
558858954659069952,Rance,22,Vampire Hunter D maybe
558859122137890848,Rance,21,it;s good anime movie
558859169155776525,Rance,39,action scenes are good too but it's old
