558434031209938944,Roak,9,i love it
558434071462805505,Roak,74,discovery is one of my favorite albums ever and this was such a cool thing
558434720648790028,ScrewySqrl,326,there are 3 basic Matsumoto character designs: Ruggedly handsome leading young men with bed head and sideburns (Harlock_ Kodai_ LEad Guitar above)_ Wan maidens with long hair between mid-back and floor length (Maetel_ Emeraldas_ Starsha_ Yuki Mori_ Queen Millenia_ etc)_ and short gonks with beady eyes (Tetsuro_ Dr Sane_ etc)

558755060746813461,windup13ird,7,Thanks!
558755127599562773,ricey_mess,64,Also this isn't ecchi_ but it's a great romance and my fav manga
558755138542764035,ricey_mess,48,https://myanimelist.net/manga/46282/Chikan_Otoko
558755214929297438,Homura,25,isn't nozoki ana a hentai
558755245056851988,windup13ird,170,I had also thought of doing Black Clover which is a guilty pleasure read of mine_  but the beginning of the anime has some real pacing issues_ or at least is really slow.
558755312585408547,ricey_mess,55,Well close enough to it_ but they asked for super ecchi
558755439047737344,ricey_mess,26,Has romance throughout too
558755440377462784,windup13ird,224,Which is a shame because from what I see it speeds up a lot after the first arc or two.NLNLI had initially wanted to show a One Piece movie as that is my jam_ but theres a bit too much fanservice_ like Nami in Strong World ;_;
558755741649993728,ricey_mess,36,Daily Lives has no fan service in it
558755761233199105,Jean,8,Digimon?
558755765431697411,ricey_mess,18,Also it's funny af
558755821660536852,ScrewySqrl,65,slightly ecchi romance?NLhmm...Girls Bravo_ Tenchi Muyo_ Love Hina
558755866334068736,JakX,119,<@511249794325282818> I read Jimi was midara already and it was perfect for what I wanted_ is Nozoki ana  close to it ?
558755911578157060,windup13ird,84,Dont know enough about Lives to show tonight_ but I have it saved for later viewing.
558755975356743720,windup13ird,25,Since comedy is my thing.
558755976640069646,ricey_mess,68,Uhh it's longer but has like hella sex scenes  <@317955189313241098>
558756010374725662,ScrewySqrl,65,TEnchi and Love Hina are harems_ but most ecchi romance is harems
558756045560741898,JakX,28,<@511249794325282818> thanks
558756083200426018,Homura,14,dagashi kashi?
558756121830096907,ricey_mess,23,It's more ecchi I'd say
558756625998151680,ricey_mess,95,<@362067284002603009> it's tied for my too 3 fav comedies along with Hinamatsuri and Grand Blue
558756702846189601,ricey_mess,72,Idk if Hina counts as shounen but it's another great safe anime for kids
558756792633524245,ricey_mess,22,Really wholesome stuff
558756897277214733,Twat,26,Grand blue was interesting
558756906743627794,ricey_mess,65,And starts off with a dope fight scene (the only one in the show)
558756980592869394,Twat,38,Half the jokes didn't resonant with me
558757098150690827,Twat,41,But the rest I found really fucking funny
558757148541321216,ricey_mess,22,The manga is great btw
558757177519636503,ricey_mess,26,Funnier than the show even
558757214672650250,Twat,21,Yeah I read the manga
558757289088122880,Twat,65,I didn't find the running gag about them getting naked that funny
558757393463377970,Twat,69,Like it wasn't annoying other than the fact to seemed to take up time
558757474635874315,ricey_mess,29,Ah_ I thought it was funny af
558757827871637532,Twat,170,>most of cast gets naked NL>New character is shocked and starts freaking outNL>One of the female cast members says something along the lines of "I hate that I'm used to it"
558757916824305674,Twat,38,Now I can see how some find that funny
558758048638959628,Twat,83,But to me I just didn't get it because I could predict when it was going to come up
558762277017485312,windup13ird,95,Digimon I could roll with it if I can find it. The isekai premise makes it start pretty quickly
558762286462795796,windup13ird,100,Speaking of Digimon movie_ I did debate Summer Wars but I think it would be good for slightly older.
558815569617616896,Kaiki,77,What is better? Nana_ A place further than the universe_ or The tatami galaxy
558815733237153792,NuttyNutt,44,Nana doesn't have an ending_ so there's that
558816000938868746,Legend,34,Those are all very different shows
558816262676021249,Kaiki,19,ok nana is out then
558816473901039616,Legend,42,Doesn't make it not worth the watch though
558828973400915978,Durinthal,66,I like Nana more than the other two <:yuishrug:529569462207250433>
558830590346919936,SirPokerface,76,is mekakucity actors any good_ watching the first episode_ looks interesting
558832096538394625,EndlessEight,33,its one of my lowest ranked shows
558832112351051796,Homura,5,omege
558832128133955585,Homura,3,lul
558832152234688513,Homura,17,it's not terrible
558832171696259072,Homura,24,but not that good for me
558834997994192907,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),36,I'll always be another vote for nana
558835104357810176,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),96,<@90537621817655296> nana's anime ending is fine_ it's just the manga that doesnt have an ending
558835196229582858,ricey_mess,26,its good if you like drama
558853295754706955,ScrewySqrl,50,A place further ths the Univrse is better by miles
558853423143976961,ScrewySqrl,27,It's #3 on my all time best
558855483826503681,Rance,61,can someone recommend me some good anime related to communism
558855541120827392,Rance,42,struggle of working class against the rich
558858808307351552,ricey_mess,50,Is there a movie about like_ demon/monster hunters
558858828825755668,ricey_mess,22,with good fight scenes
558858913592639488,Rance,24,Hellsing Ultimate counts
558858934849634334,Rance,19,but its not a movie
558858954659069952,Rance,22,Vampire Hunter D maybe
558859122137890848,Rance,21,it;s good anime movie
558859169155776525,Rance,39,action scenes are good too but it's old
558870800422141954,LoneWolf,55,i think ive asked this before but im gonna ask it again
558870919079133210,LoneWolf,106,Saying this cause it relates to the question: I've watched a no filler run of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden.
558870985382690836,LoneWolf,64,Should I start One Piece and do a no filler run? is it worth it?
558871068572385300,ricey_mess,36,I hear it's better to read the manga
558871136683819008,Homura,118,there's not really any filler episodes in one piece besides the g8 arc_ i'd advise reading the manga or using one pace
558871137082146836,LoneWolf,63,i know <@511249794325282818> but i probably wont read the manga
558871163724627978,ZeXm,5,do it
558871175116226600,ZeXm,16,one piece is fun
558871221580857344,LoneWolf,45,what makes it so good? <@!250412368708894720>
558871229147381760,ImperialSympathizer,53,watching OP through the first 200ish episodes is good
558871257710329857,„Ö†.„Ö†,67,<@475040852553629706> wut there's plenty of filler arcs in wan piss
558871263326502922,ImperialSympathizer,47,I recommend switching to the manga at somepoint
558871280326148097,ImperialSympathizer,21,usually post timeskip

558871610115751946,Homura,16,yeah g8 was good
558871655380811796,„Ö†.„Ö†,42,Yeah Hosoda directed a few episodes for G8

560626335882543104,MagicAllie,38,Hi_ im looking for magical girl shows.

560626689030225935,MagicAllie,76,i watched a lot of magical girls_ i really like the darker more serious ones
560626811021819989,MagicAllie,29,my faves are utena and madoka
560627043541319717,NuttyNutt,87,Could try tweeny witches then. https://myanimelist.net/anime/872/Mahou_Shoujo-tai_Arusu

560627130980106250,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),43,not really "darker"_ but definitely serious
560627232888848395,MagicAllie,4,oooo
560627257647824896,MagicAllie,35,i've never heard of either of these
560627269765431296,MagicAllie,7,thanks!
560627562326523915,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),48,the animation quality of figure 17 is incredible
560627642521616395,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),58,each episode feels like an OVA_ must've had a large budget
560627791239053358,ZeXm,22,hmmm looks interesting
560627802383187979,ZeXm,7,ill ptw
560628118998482984,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),46,also_ a sci fi mahou shoujo is pretty uncommon
560628261504155699,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),24,also_ that OP is rockin'
560628964343808000,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),43,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZWg94hJ_SQ
560629939666288651,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),157,i really don't get to recommend this show enough. in the end_ all mahou shoujos are really about growth and coming of age and that's what Figure 17 does best
560630058968940554,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),124,the fights and action sequences aren't important_ they're just a plot device to explore the MC as she adapts to her new life
560630117366497332,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),37,it's really a neat little scifi/drama
560630482249973797,ZeXm,27,nice ill look forward to it
560632203344740362,Mob,1,3
560634382885453834,Mercrist,38,is parasyte the maxim  worth watching?
560634423893032970,Mercrist,47,i saw a trailer for it and it seems really edgy
560634474384064515,Mercrist,79,while i like edgy shows a lot i dont like it when they go into cringe territory
560634536178876416,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),23,eh_ it's not super edgy
560634577828184064,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),39,there's edge_ but you wont cut yourself
560634661630509066,Mercrist,7,ah nice
560634673651515413,Mercrist,21,the best kind of edge
560634679171219456,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),72,it's worth watching if you like action shows with a slightly darker tone
560634732333891620,Mercrist,53,is it a seinen or does it play out more like a shonen
560634764277841940,Mercrist,35,it kinda seems like tokyo ghoul too
560634833211097114,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),37,honestly it's somewhere in the middle
