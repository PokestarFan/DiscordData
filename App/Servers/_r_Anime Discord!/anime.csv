558433384142209063,SSR Majinken,141,Yeah YYH_ DB_ Digimon etc. are all great shows within my heart_ but the quality of the story I receive from other shows just overshadows them
558433510008946688,Sen,56,but a top 10 for me is about the mark shows leave on you
558433552018964481,Lucidious,11,Imma say it
558433558784376897,SSR Majinken,12,yep exactly!
558433560613093379,Lucidious,9,Don't ban
558433573833539595,Roak,7,depends
558433604246568971,Lucidious,29,One punch man is so overrated
558433610319921167,SSR Majinken,64,HxH was only first place for me because Meruem < no other reason
558433620130398238,Roak,26,<:bait:529569461053685760>
558433626832764948,Lucidious,36,<:GWqlabsMonkaSs:393085114403389442>
558433726472650762,Lucidious,19,I'm not baiting btw
558433743040151554,Nomeru,30,these are my favorites for now
558433752015962117,Roak,21,thats a baity opinion
558433755870789662,Sir Hatsley,25,overrated is a baity word
558433770529751040,Homura,35,Chimeta ant arc was dragged out imo
558433771683053578,Sen,129,sure I loved sorayori for example and find it amazing_ but no way it would overshadow something like Slayers which I grew up with
558433794257059850,Brother Spicy,31,<@91970544789897216> based list
558433843330285579,SSR Majinken,133,It depends on how much the show can affect you on there best scene in the anime like for example meruemxkomugi or Shigatsu the letter
558433848200003586,Roak,61,nothing there is under a 9 for me <:sugoi:512159062444736512>

558433873500045322,Homura,45,Gurren laggan <:hyperawoo:358633552562225152>
558433891845668874,Lucidious,141,I genuinely think it gets too much praise yes I think it's a good anime but it doesn't deserve the praise that it gets  <@261211257363759106>
558433928512274475,Sir Hatsley,14,shinsekai yori
558433950188437514,Sir Hatsley,16,under a 9 for me
558433957423611904,Roak,82,why would you continue the conversation of something that was deleted for a reason
558433968064823296,Brother Spicy,60,kaguya doesn‚Äôt affect me like that but it‚Äôs high quality fun

558434104085839914,Brother Spicy,37,Roak why does your name keep evolving
558434146607955971,Roak,64,because people keep messing it up <:OMEGALUL:478691765529083904>

558434622195892225,Brother Spicy,69,I just read Oryx and Crake and it reminded me a lot of Shinsekai Yori
558434676688289813,Brother Spicy,28,I might have to rewatch that
558434723962028032,Nomeru,49,Reef who are you and what have you done with Road
558434804509573123,Nomeru,27,SSY is great on rewatch too
558434817805385728,Sen,113,I watched shinsekai yori and then I read Animal Farm because I'm a man of culture <:shinocool:529569462681337856>
558434826294657031,Nomeru,27,pretty different experience
558434878568398871,Brother Spicy,46,but with psychic powers instead of bio warfare
558434897933631513,Sir Hatsley,22,i tried rewatching ssy
558434920486404099,Sir Hatsley,25,i still really dislike it
558434951045840899,Roak,37,animal farm is unironically worse ssy
558434997241905192,Roak,30,okay that was really baity LOL

558435118939766804,Sen,11,I mean bait
558435182000996374,Brother Spicy,76,animal farm is the type beat to make 6th graders feel deep when they read it
558435196119023616,Brother Spicy,16,It‚Äôs good though
558435264213680143,Sen,60,all weebs are equal_ but some are more equal than the others
558435402806067227,Roak,164,~~animal farm has a very very good message against communism which is mainly why i love it but thats very highly political and volatile and i think we should stop~~
558435428542447626,Brother Spicy,39,like people who put Eva in their top 10
558435447789846528,Roak,30,<:waitwhat:490350733951238174>
558435460779868170,Brother Spicy,31,they are more equal than others

558435626765254662,Thrashinuva,78,if equality means mental disorders then sure I'm on board with that assessment
558435644393652225,Sen,166,Beef_ nobody made this political yet you decided to add that in just to have a reason to stop it when it didn't exist in the fist place <:waitwhat:490350733951238174>

558436029292609548,Brother Spicy,78,did you just imply people who enjoy the high art of Anno‚Äôs psyche are mental üò°

558436362747904011,Brother Spicy,23,that sound track is NUT
558436418121367582,Roak,57,odd time signatures make the prog head in me nut a little
558436421447188480,Homura,1,üî©
558436478649106473,araneaesGrasp,63,I don't really like Eva much_ but damn is the soundtrack great.
558436529077223425,Nomeru,81,think I'm about at the end of the votoms vietnam arc though I don't know for sure
558436554691969027,Brother Spicy,17,Until 3.0 that is
558436594651234344,Brother Spicy,31,then we learn to play the piano
558436606353342494,snowwhistle,30,I prefer Nadia to Eva_ mostly.
558436644290822144,Nomeru,139,oh roak you missed when I figured those out kinda. well by figured out I mean I decided to ignore the bottom number as worthless info to me
558436662351364209,snowwhistle,45,I still need to see Anno's other work though.
558436669863231489,Sir Hatsley,30,mmm especially that island arc
558436699940716554,Brother Spicy,13,What‚Äôs Nadia?
558436722694815764,Sir Hatsley,26,nadia is anno's worst work
558436748594774017,Sir Hatsley,24,cuz he left halfway thru
558436763924955156,Sir Hatsley,15,legit this time
558436787312263189,Sir Hatsley,44,unlike karekano where he never actually left
558436793712771082,snowwhistle,114,Hot take... I don't think the Island arc is quite as bad (sans 3 or 4 specific episodes) as most people say it is.
558436824574459916,Sir Hatsley,49,but nadia flunks so hard it can never recover tbh
558436837929123850,Roak,21,thats a good idea nom
558436858829209610,Sir Hatsley,47,i also really didnt like the final arc of nadia
558436897089912834,Sen,43,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0n-9X1MuMQ
558436950848045057,snowwhistle,142,Anno didn't leave Nadia. He was so busy working on the final five episodes that he had to leave episodes 23-34 with his friend Shinji Higuchi.
558437124198629376,Brother Spicy,17,Is Karekano good?
558437141642870794,Sir Hatsley,17,karekano is great
558437170520522782,Brother Spicy,28,That might be a watch for me
558437183552356352,Sir Hatsley,30,wait island arc was higuchi???
558437222462783499,Sir Hatsley,37,higuchi as in... dragon pilot higuchi
558437234085199890,Sir Hatsley,23,so thats why its so bad
558437243107147787,Thrashinuva,68,I'll stick with this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0z08OpmEPc
558437259737563137,Sir Hatsley,43,at least anno knows that island arc was bad
558437285679464459,Roak,29,NAAAAAAAAKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
558437295171305483,Sir Hatsley,55,and he edited them out of the show in his recut version
558437342356963328,snowwhistle,45,I will defend episode 30 and 31 to the grave.
558437344328286208,Roak,37,i fell in love with gits this weekend
558437405162602508,Roak,18,hadnt ever seen it

558437502927765504,Thrashinuva,99,the hollywood movie is actually good if you ignore peoples fake and wrong claims about whitewashing
558437531134459905,Roak,27,<:yikes:546511204252778516>
558437575618986035,Roak,26,dont phrase it like *that*
558437583135309836,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),42,i should watch it sooner rather than later
558437590542450699,Sen,44,I hear they went ahead and changed the plot?
558437598998167602,snowwhistle,182,Also_ despite the Island arc being a big mess there's little scenes in it that I did like. I could see the Island Arc being reedited into 3 or 4 episodes and being a serviceable arc.
558437615859269642,Sen,18,that's a big no no
558437658175733770,Sir Hatsley,39,i mean_ the claims arent fake and wrong
558437675221254197,Sir Hatsley,26,and the movie is still bad
558437681714036737,Roak,50,gits with no transhumanism themes is no gits to me
558437685098840092,Thrashinuva,35,the plots kind of condensed version
558437687418159120,Sir Hatsley,29,so <:bait:529569461053685760>
558437723942420511,Thrashinuva,54,and they are fake and wrong_ there was no whitewashing
558437729877360640,Sir Hatsley,20,transhumanism is dum
558437756695609344,Roak,36,transhumanism is fucking fascinating
558437766011027456,Roak,16,also please stop
558437817089523723,Sir Hatsley,31,you know my thoughts on it reef
558437859686744094,Roak,42,1) this should be in <#378707055327969300>
558437864141225995,Sir Hatsley,21,if you dont_ ask sami
558437877554610177,Roak,32,2) check the channel topic there
558437926791544832,snowwhistle,121,I've only ever seen the anime film version of GITS_ but I thought it had some fascinating ideas outside of transhumanism.
558437933854621696,Roak,0,
558437946445791266,Sir Hatsley,75,i've already seen enough toxic takes to just block the new Less Cool thrash
558437968981786625,Roak,14,oh it does lol
558437993812197379,Roak,34,i was being a little general there
558438082353954816,Sen,47,you need to watch Vampire Hunter D and Bloolust
558438105439272970,Sir Hatsley,10,hell yeah!
558438120257880064,Sir Hatsley,13,kawajiri baby
558438130823462922,Roak,93,my real thoughts are more like gits without nerdy humanism themes and technobabble is no gits
558438174792220672,Roak,41,havent seen anything from kawajiri either
558438210527690792,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),84,"need to" is a little much for vampire hunter d. it's a good movie_ but need to? nah
558438253590478880,Sir Hatsley,43,kawajiri is not for u if you hate gobslayer
558438256031825930,Sir Hatsley,3,but
558438260637171742,Sir Hatsley,8,its also
558438265573867533,Sir Hatsley,7,so good
558438300105441282,Sen,46,the visuals in bloodlust are on fucking poinyt
558438319802023957,Sir Hatsley,27,i like wicked city the most
558438352660201473,Roak,80,well i hate goblin slayer for plot reasons and not for visual or tone reasons so
558438371282780162,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),58,it looks nice yeah_ but not enough to call it a must watch
558438376336916531,Roak,21,does that still apply
558438453843460096,Sir Hatsley,50,kawajiri has many scenes depicting sexual violence
558438477595672602,snowwhistle,108,Goblin Slayer is fine. It's nothing special_ but I found it entertaining isekai trash with some funny lines.
558438477986004993,Roak,19,yeah im cool w that
558438481517477908,Sir Hatsley,32,in every single one of his works
558438527268814849,Roak,35,as long as its not like_ fetishized
558438550220177408,Roak,18,and tbh it depends
558438573897154560,Roak,45,but yeah im not inherently turned off by rape
558438591894913029,Sir Hatsley,14,its very kinky
558438616913936385,Roak,3,lol
558438661662834709,EndlessEight,28,how is goblin slayer isekai?
558438700229459968,Sir Hatsley,27,(fits entire boob in mouth)
558438702339194890,snowwhistle,17,Whoops. It's not.
558438718147526657,Brother Spicy,111,Goblin slayer is just interesting because I hadn‚Äôt seen dark fantasy much before that wasn‚Äôt SUPER over the top
558438788926537753,snowwhistle,115,I've just begun to associate all fantasy anime with isekai because 90% of the time now if it's fantasy it's isekai.
558438795146559498,Brother Spicy,26,like hellsing or something
558438914193620995,snowwhistle,65,(not all fantasy_ the European dungeons-and-dragons type fantasy)
558438945260699651,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),61,what about books? you didnt read forgotten realms growing up?
558438969029820417,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),26,dark fantasy is everywhere
558439003863646208,Brother Spicy,22,FR is not dark fantasy
558439013304762415,Legend,92,Speaking of Fantasy_ I think I know what my next show will be <:rikkaawe:324623075507175424>
558439029847359490,Brother Spicy,10,not really
558439043625517088,Brother Spicy,13,I read Drizzt
558439065347686403,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),39,there's not really much of a difference
558439130036437002,Sen,115,anybody here watched Colorful? I really liked the movie and when I looked at the score turns out everybody hated it
558439137300971521,Brother Spicy,45,No rape ever in D&D books from my estimation?
558439166162239499,Brother Spicy,33,or the heroes being in real peril
558439182595260426,Thrashinuva,115,I wouldn't consider that politics otherwise I wouldn't have mentioned it_ it's either a claim that is true or isn't
558439198126768296,Thrashinuva,25,and yeah Colorful is good
558439252128432148,Sir Hatsley,30,I didn't see GS as dark at all
558439258315161600,Roak,26,thats controversial though
558439269275009024,Roak,41,<:joedempseyrollssafe:454718235380809738>
558439349625028609,Thrashinuva,72,you could say 1+1=2 is controversial_ but it doesn't mean it actually is
558439367971045383,Sir Hatsley,14,Joe is so good
558439382277947392,Sir Hatsley,10,I love him
558439389538287636,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),75,there's enough sexual violence in FR. there doesnt need to be explicit rape
558439482630864908,Roak,113,pretty obvious what kind of controversy we're talking about here_ please stop discussing this and move on_ thanks
558439633655037966,Durinthal,110,I'm tempted to watch Interstella again based solely on seeing the characters in <#268515018897620995> just now
558439644375547915,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),88,gore and explicit violence of any kind are rarely necessary. it's mostly used to be edgy
558439687262306329,Roak,9,lmao duri
558439726797946893,Roak,60,ive seen it like 4 or so times for basically the same reason
558439731310886913,Thrashinuva,157,hey look_ okay_ I follow rules_ but to be completely honest with the kind of reaction here_ I'm not sure I actually know what controversy we're talking about
558439732741275662,Sen,338,the irony is that rape is a huge genre in doujins which are very popular among anime fans yet when it happens in a show all of a sudden everyone is like "oh noes_ why did they sexualize this_ can't handle it_ gonna faint" Edit: already finished writing this before you said move on_ so gonna leave it as my final reply_ don't kill me Beef
558439767746936840,Roak,29,being reminded that it exists
558439798050783243,Roak,38,nah thats not what i was talking about
558439818074390528,Sen,8,oh_ okay
558439839477923880,Sen,25,I wasn't paying attention
558439894431825960,Roak,89,i meant the whitewashing gits things which had been frankly washed away by that point too
558439936831782922,WEEB 2K19,65,I'm so excited for the final episode of The Promised Neverland S1

558440921071616042,snowwhistle,69,I mean_ we technically don't. But that was a VERY concerning trailer.

558441875770703882,Durinthal,70,aren't most of them fairly similar_ at least when seen from the front?
558441962001399810,Durinthal,44,or maybe not <:akkothonk:529569460743569430>
558442039931437067,Durinthal,66,Ichika's shortest_ Yotsuba's still not even shoulder length right?
558442065503977472,Sacchi,64,Yeah. I'm also assuming hair color_ voice and stuff is the same.
558442180960845844,Durinthal,61,other three would be fairly similar if not styled differently
558442248610775070,Sacchi,26,There is also the hairpin.
558443136490405888,Durinthal,101,I'm gonna be sad when every other Precure fails to live up to the first two non-airing ones I watched

558443922918211598,Durinthal,36,still just later this year right now

558447321591840778,Durinthal,69,if you have an unaltered screenshot and it's in their DB_ pretty well
558447352562712586,Melvin8d,77,because like theres different screenshot sizes_ different encodes for videos_
558447454698078238,Durinthal,19,it's fuzzy matching

558447688270479385,Durinthal,247,"The image search algorithm is designed for almost-exact match_ not similar match. It analyze the color layout of the image. So_ when your image is not a full un-cropped original 16:9 screenshot (i.e. cropped image)_ the search would likely fail."

558448370226823169,Durinthal,25,not enough CGI for Nodame
558448699534213130,Nomeru,85,Hm_ heard (between 2 guys) "Omae wo aishiteita"_ subs say "you are my dearest friend"
558448750394343434,Nomeru,60,when I hear aishiteiru_ that seems like more than friendship
558448795315339265,Roak,7,that is
558448820808056842,Roak,25,absolutely more than that
558448847605465089,Roak,36,that line is literally "i loved you"
558449246487969804,Nomeru,54,yeah_ wasn't sure if it was ever used as anything else

558755538339364864,Durinthal,9,good idea
558755545499303957,OliveOil,28,Unless they also streamed it
558755560909176832,Rev,38,*cough* Gosenzosama Banbanzai! *cough*
558755674394460171,Durinthal,94,now you're gonna have me thinking about a full Fate franchise rewatch on my way home from work
558755789431505035,Rev,37,You have my sympathies and apologies.
558755831412424704,OliveOil,40,I just read a summary and called it done
558755840341966858,Rev,35,I _never said_ it was a _good_ idea
558755912517550100,OliveOil,36,So i‚Äôll claim *i‚Äôve played the game*
558755936810958848,Durinthal,31,it's definitely not a good idea
558755987100532748,Durinthal,32,I hate myself for considering it
558756050791301121,OliveOil,16,I‚Äôve watched ubw
558756074560290861,OliveOil,15,I liked hf more
558756212334657537,Rev,74,Hate me for bringing it up the first place instead. It's more therapeutic.
558756229917442049,OliveOil,66,And this is going to be a trilogy movie in a span of 3 years right
558756231209287695,Sir Hatsley,21,last encore was great
558756238981070878,Sir Hatsley,8,its like
558756255762612224,Sir Hatsley,10,'the room'
558756262544670740,Sir Hatsley,9,but worse
558756273160454164,Durinthal,112,too bad HF doesn't fit at the end by any means_ otherwise it could be fun leading up to its release/availability
558756302562787334,OliveOil,22,I‚Äôve played fate/extra
558756328022212629,OliveOil,13,The first one
558756433173151754,OliveOil,14,I sucked at it
558756443013251073,Durinthal,39,I haven't seen Last Encore or Illya yet

558756514228076548,Nomeru,20,there_ hf at the end
558756700572614656,Nomeru,11,forgot deen
558756813550518272,Durinthal,72,also soon to have multiple FGO anime to fit in <:LUL:529569462752641034>
558756871624720493,Homura,10,whats fapo
558756901995806731,Nomeru,14,fate apocrypha
558756903920861214,Durinthal,14,Fate/Apocrypha
558756930475130881,Homura,21,isn't that a spin off
558756930915532813,Durinthal,26,with the best abbreviation
558756937945186341,Homura,1,ü§î
558756983830872098,Durinthal,15,most of Fate is
558757078429204481,Nomeru,70,remove spinoffs and you're just left with ubw and hf I think_ and deen
558757112113528842,Nomeru,49,maybe h/z depending on how loosely you count that
558757849908641794,Rev,29,What about Fate/strange fake?
558757858838183937,GreatestSaltboy,24,damn rev why you do this
558757878748676106,Durinthal,26,if only there was an anime
558757953486716944,Durinthal,39,IIRC that's the spinoff set in America?
558757976777949194,Rev,16,Yeah_ by Narita.
558758040728371200,Rev,98,Nasu gave him feedback on it and everything; isn't the idea of Fate that most things can be canon?
558758080645693456,Durinthal,42,don't remember if it's a separate timeline
558758219992924202,Rev,109,I think F/sf is definitely after Fate/Zero_ at least. I know some people were trying to fit it on a timeline.
558758327018979339,Durinthal,130,IIRC the main canon is Zero -> Stay Night (all of it) -> Hollow Ataraxia -> Grand OrderNLbut I don't remember where I got that from
558758627134144523,GreatestSaltboy,81,maybe apo before go too because it has characters from there play important roles
558758705479286784,Rev,49,"why you do this" // because Narita is a calling.
558758869908586515,Rev,201,Also because_ though I'm not someone who's actually into/experienced Fate proper_ I know that f/sf is well-liked so far by fate fans both in and outside of Japan. (also Vol 5 is coming out next month).
558758954620944389,Durinthal,59,Apocrypha timeline doesn't have Zero and the rest happening
558759075752574978,Durinthal,53,though its servant concepts are utilized for FGO_ yes
558759257714196515,Nomeru,90,I kinda think only way I'll ever watch anything past zero is if they adapt the first route
558759349342961676,GreatestSaltboy,58,you don't have any choice with fate route outside VN sadly
558759350873751556,Nomeru,30,and that seems pretty unlikely
558759413117353986,Durinthal,30,<:yuishrug:529569462207250433>
558759432364752917,Nomeru,32,I've just kinda given up on fate
558759480611962882,GreatestSaltboy,51,deen *kinda* attempts to be a fate route adaptation
558759491261300736,Durinthal,11,that's fair
558759599063302184,Durinthal,65,there's a youtube edit of Deen's that tries to stick to the route
558759621842698240,GreatestSaltboy,52,but it changes to try concepts from other routes too
558759628939460619,Rev,165,Hm_ this claims that Nasu said Strange/fake is similar to FGO in 2017 <https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/65e3fm/nasus_blog_april_15th_2017_clarified_the/>
558759666306252802,Durinthal,40,but I wouldn't try that with the rewatch
558759699068092426,GreatestSaltboy,39,yeah but that's jumpy and not enjoyable
558759850046128148,Durinthal,59,I still think I'd go UBW first_ make Zero the prequel it is
558759912331804718,Durinthal,77,Fate route isn't that necessary_ it's mostly an introduction to the franchise
558759957865168896,Durinthal,74,Saber gets shafted somewhat as a result but <:yuishrug:529569462207250433>
558759961790906379,GreatestSaltboy,24,it's much better with it
558760137502752768,GreatestSaltboy,69,some things from ubw you'll just miss without context from fate route
558760192741867531,Sen,60,you could add KnK in there to make everything more enjoyable
558760203026432009,Durinthal,50,probably_ it's been too long since I've watched it
558760330327752734,Durinthal,45,have a single KnK movie after every Fate show
558760365887062034,Durinthal,34,in release order because of course
558760366142652417,REAMS,36,really hope ufotable adapt Tsukihime
558760402041962497,REAMS,26,after they're done with HF
558760652114624542,Kindred,66,and then release the tsukihime remake <:PepeGA:528245148442820619>
558760714739908659,GreatestSaltboy,34,<:GWqlabsNever:398950971079917569>
558760902183092239,Durinthal,32,Tsukihime remake into Carnival 2
558760947154681877,GreatestSaltboy,40,<:GWseremePeepoGGERS:402867853906280450>
558761034584948756,OliveOil,34,Carnival phantasm is the best fate
558761068214616067,Durinthal,23,it's my second favorite
558761089093861397,GreatestSaltboy,29,and mahoyoru adaptation after
558761108802895875,Durinthal,15,best is cooking
558761171591626763,GreatestSaltboy,16,emiya-san a good
558761399233544242,Durinthal,31,I now kinda want to watch Illya
558761540849762309,GreatestSaltboy,36,I just want to watch oath under snow
558761548395315200,Durinthal,68,maybe next year if I'm gonna go ahead with a magical girl theme then
558761560672043009,OliveOil,9,Yuri trap
558761582276902912,GreatestSaltboy,54,but people telling me I need the prior 3 seasons first
558761627097497600,Durinthal,14,I have no idea
558761812259110922,GreatestSaltboy,44,so it'll be quite the work until I get to it
558761816675581972,Rev,142,Eh_ I gave in and started reading F/sf Vol 1 despite not having played/read/seen any of the other storylines_ don't let your dreams be dreams.
558761832848818178,OliveOil,27,Prisma ilya is a total bait
558761905297031168,Durinthal,10,yuri bait?
558761916261203970,GreatestSaltboy,66,nah I want my stuff to make sense <:GWqlabsKek:393085130219978752>
558761947441528832,Rev,43,Yeah_ but this is Fate we're talking about.
558761952634077184,OliveOil,3,Yes

558762010289111040,Durinthal,52,what if I don't want to watch it for the yuri though
558762062709260289,Durinthal,35,I know that seems like a weird idea
558762065335025677,OliveOil,15,It‚Äôs still bait
558762082837987363,GreatestSaltboy,39,idk about bait but it certainly is yuri
558762114962030603,GreatestSaltboy,42,that kiss scene <:lewd:308002602019454986>
558762121618522143,OliveOil,33,Because you **can‚Äôt escape yuri**

558762424824627211,GreatestSaltboy,55,just a 80 hour VN and you're ready_ practically nothing
558762517422145536,Durinthal,96,honestly the top part is all you needNL"So you want to watch Fate/Stay Night"NL"Protip: **don't**"

558762702294745130,GreatestSaltboy,18,but it's agreeable
558762799166390292,CritSrc,95,yeah_ you just sacrifice your life to the Holy Waifu Altar and PRAY TO NASU WITH ALL YOUR MONE!
558762864014393345,Durinthal,68,should include a Melty Blood tournament in the middle of the rewatch
558762897975541770,GreatestSaltboy,35,spoilers in the VN ending cards btw

558772173159006209,Legend,27,How's Toradora treating you
558772937281241113,jj2018,48,It‚Äôs amazing. I‚Äôm going to resume watching today
558772956831023107,jj2018,24,Going to start episode 7
558773017661145098,jj2018,54,I love the new character girl. The popular famous girl
558783541434122242,Nomeru,25,only anime staff position
558783585348354098,Nomeru,38,no one else listed as character design
558783726889467914,Tea4Dragons,71,it says original character desing_ meaning someone adapted to the anime
558783825170268173,Nomeru,43,that person didn't work on the manga though
558783839363792897,Nomeru,9,ann lists
558783891624689665,Jean,26,Amano did the novel covers
558783902668423170,Tea4Dragons,39,Guin Saga is a LN thats still releasing
558783935790972959,Tea4Dragons,33,<:konatathink:529569462505046027>
558784001356201994,Nomeru,54,then isn't listed as working on whatever the source is
558784056897306636,Nomeru,56,that is the only relating credit they have_ which is odd
558784523660165140,Nomeru,51,Also not clear what original character design means
558784534955425794,Tea4Dragons,104,well studio Satelight being the one adapting it says a lot to why it looks bad but has great backgrounds
558784549715443724,Jean,53,Did someone inherit the novels after the author died?
558784589053820928,Nomeru,110,does that mean they did character design for the novels_ or they did character design for new anime characters
558784693231812664,Tea4Dragons,49,on Anilist it says the novels are still releasing
558784779819024384,Jean,43,Oh she must have had someone take over then
558784780993429514,Tea4Dragons,49,if it got cancelled they probably would change it
558784818792628224,Nomeru,22,might be up in the air
558784859502280725,Nomeru,33,says still publishing on mal also
558785017682067467,Nomeru,24,when did the author die?
558785081200869416,Jean,33,Right around when the anime aired
558785180161277953,Nomeru,19,oh 10 years ago huh
558785332666171393,Nomeru,65,wikipedia shows 130 volumes with nothing released since 2009_ idk
558785411141337098,Tea4Dragons,3,oof
558785473636728853,Tea4Dragons,47,is there any other LN that is longer than that?
558785557874868224,Tea4Dragons,26,130 volumes seems too much
558785620332380160,Nomeru,209,```A record 100 volumes were originally planned_[3] but the final total stands at 130 volumes and 22 side-story novels_ with the last four volumes and the twenty-second side novel published posthumously.[4]```
558785693313138690,Nomeru,44,so they did release 5 volumes after she died
558785731380641822,Nomeru,22,sounds pretty done now
558785801228648463,Nomeru,6,or not
558785843502907392,Nomeru,248,```The main story of Guin Saga resumed on November 8_ 2013_ four years after the passing of the original author. Y≈´ Godai published Volume 131 Parro no Ankoku on that date_ followed by Yume Yohino's Volume 132 Cylon no Banka in December 2013.[9]```
558785917700145162,Jean,46,No idea I think the majority aren't translated
558786008477597716,Tea4Dragons,58,im only on ep 2 but i cant see how the story can be so big
558786158302330900,Nomeru,81,really interesting how they say they started out planning on it being 100 volumes
558786179462463489,Nomeru,25,how do you plan for that?
558786294667411488,Tea4Dragons,18,:bigbrain: i guess
558786724537565196,Jean,41,80s was a good time to take risks I guess

558789137386176513,gibby,3,lol
558789194605133824,Sir Hatsley,19,I don't dislike CGI
558789275295154186,Sir Hatsley,57,But polygon pictures needs to change their damn aesthetic
558789285650890783,gibby,25,I hate CGI_ but that's me
558789631676645385,Sir Hatsley,9,Houseki--

558789831979958282,Sir Hatsley,3,UWU
558789839227584513,Levitacus,3,ofc
558789873654300682,carnage panda,5,Good.
558789989224284160,Sen,83,is this a reinterpretation or something? or no longer human has always been sci fi?
558790016596180992,Sen,17,had no idea if so
558790079984959509,Sky King,49,A little bit unrelated but_ having never seen HxH
558790125182517249,Sir Hatsley,14,It's not scifi
558790137170100224,Sky King,54,I never realized how much in common it has with Naruto
558790168723587082,Sky King,13,Nen -> Chakra
558790193755324426,Levitacus,6,I mean
558790199564304411,Sky King,15,Killua ~ Sasuke
558790222284849193,Levitacus,10,Not really
558790257596956692,Sen,44,except they function fundamentally different
558790266786676748,Homura,26,i don't see the comparison
558790293940469776,Sky King,51,Prestigious families that work the kids to the bone
558790310440992768,Sky King,19,Lightning abilities
558790318170963969,Sir Hatsley,8,You know
558790324743438347,Sky King,21,I mean purely surface
558790336122585099,carnage panda,41,Is there a character named Itachi in HxH?
558790352580902953,Sky King,40,Not digging into the themese or whatever
558790355437223953,Sen,42,lighting abilities were invented by naruto
558790376815591444,Sir Hatsley,24,D&D is a lot like naruto
558790429131145235,Sir Hatsley,15,Magic -> Chakra
558790465369931793,Sky King,23,Yep I'm getting roasted
558790478649098270,Sky King,10,delet this
558790617635880960,Levitacus,90,That's what happens when you say stupid things <:GWaobloChildPepeShrug:407618817569718272>
558790685441130537,carnage panda,81,Dororo ||Remember when Dororo invented the backstabbing character named Itachi?||
558790702008369153,Sky King,83,Ok but the comparison between magic and chakra is way different than nen and chakra
558790767464939520,Sky King,63,Nen and chakra both have the fundamental life force thing going
558790787471638576,Sky King,31,Where magic is way more generic
558790811282571274,Sky King,18,I'm digging a hole
558791130901250082,carnage panda,86,Guess I should get back to the brilliant masterpiece that is Lime Colored War Tales X.
558791444673069059,Levitacus,90,It's like chi or ki or whatever you want to call the spiritual energy of eastern religions
558791641461424132,Sen,40,take weebs for example_ they use lolirgy
558791714559492117,Sen,34,levi is adept at casting hardening
558791718443679797,Levitacus,40,And many things take inspiration from it
558791726819704860,Levitacus,9,like mana

558792423816298536,Levitacus,47,Just say it's like Baccano but with instruments
558792467416219664,Nomeru,34,levi watch any more votoms lately?
558792473699418113,Sir Hatsley,33,It will be like kids on the slope
558792491160174622,Levitacus,10,I have not
558792493425098792,Sir Hatsley,37,<:GWowoBlobCoffee:358278223018196999>
558792529525473282,Nomeru,36,I'm at 29 now_ it's been pretty good
558792565835694080,Nomeru,37,though 28 was a recap for some reason
558792630595616768,Rev,86,Baccano!_ Kids on the Slope /// what I'm hearing is "jazz" and I am here for The Jazz.
558792656424271883,Levitacus,63,I didn't really like the main girl's development when I stopped
558792720391602206,Sir Hatsley,17,It's baccano yeah
558792788607762442,Sir Hatsley,69,It's actually Naritaverse but you can't tell because it's on the moon
558792788653768708,Nomeru,94,votoms ||yeah she was useless there_ I hear in the 3rd part where I am now she really shines||
558792830600871936,Nomeru,20,Chirico is great too
558792917196603432,Levitacus,104,Also Votoms ||The second arc was just the same exact story as the first arc lul_ at least in structure||
558793320890105866,Nomeru,21,that didn't bother me
558793411965091842,Nomeru,43,doesn't seem like that will continue though
558793734767116305,Sir Hatsley,45,Does votoms follow the same formula as gundam
558793753213534260,Sir Hatsley,17,Mecha of the week
558793770460512257,Levitacus,2,no
558793780036239396,Nomeru,2,no
558793790895423488,Sir Hatsley,27,And everything is very same
558793806028341262,Sir Hatsley,4,Good
558793828631576606,Levitacus,85,Also it has the best mecha designs in anime <:GWcorbinFeelsDabMan:385111042218262529>
558793845584953354,Levitacus,23,Not that I've seen many

558793909296168970,Sir Hatsley,31,<:shakechan:529569462345793547>
558793933103038476,Nomeru,69,They are the most realistic mecha designs_ for whatever that's worth.
558793981152985098,Nomeru,48,they're like 4 meters tall_ like a personal tank
558794100648706079,Nomeru,110,bipedal though they use wheels on their feet more often than actually walking it seems. or at least like 50/50
558794285512785948,Levitacus,1,üî©
558794647573626902,NuttyNutt,154,depends on the surface_ wheels are quicker on smooth concrete when invading_ but you'll need option for walking with hazards / terrain getting in the way.
558798142443880450,Rev,25,> Naritaverse on the moon
558798420207468564,Rev,144,There's a great Baccano! x Durarara!! oneshot fic I read once where it was set in the future--far enough that humanity had colonies on the moon.
558798529234075648,Rev,43,The fic itself was set on Earth_ but still.
558798980516151300,Rev,38,Mecha designs... gotta love The Big O.

558806431143428117,carnage panda,39,I feel like this was written by Tomino.
558806436310810634,Rev,118,Moribito Episode 11 is my favorite Moribito episode probably (and ranks up there as one of my favorite anime episodes)

558812749132726282,Rev,113,Balsa and Tanda are just _so good_ as MC and secondary; as individuals_ and as individuals with a shared history.
558812900614078487,Rev,103,It's been so long since I watched Moribito from start to finish; it really deserves a rewatch sometime.

558826948629889024,Durinthal,88,I'm three days behind but the most recent episode of 3D Kanojo <:wtf:452887335730806786>
558827008503578624,Durinthal,73,not that anyone else is watching it_ which is why I was fine with waiting
558827646545559562,Sen,32,man_ besides looking gorgeous af
558827713977122857,Sen,69,there's something else to moribito_ I think it's the shot composition
558827747556720650,Sen,22,there's a lot of depth
558827859192446986,Sen,87,when characters interact with the environment it really feels 3d and appropriately wide
558827892533100574,Sen,55,for example when there's a serious fight in a big field
558827981359939602,Sen,57,they do a really good job of making that field feel legit
558828502846144532,Rev,31,(Whoop_ went and took a shower)
558828642998681621,Rev,120,I was saying yesterday that I thought Noein had good directing/camerawork_ and I think that's true for Moribito as well.
558828689630953473,Sen,19,yeah_ it's on point
558828736909410305,„Ö†.„Ö†,115,Wholeheartedly agree. Gives a good sense of scaleNLhttps://sakugabooru.com/data/91c91678c401114431f2bbb8f29d61a4.mp4

558829098072276993,Sen,81,it's a mystery why this show is so under-watched and barely talked about nowadays
558829148777349120,Rev,180,If we look at Episode 11_ my fav Moribito episode mentioned earlier...in that episode_ it sort of feels like the 'camera' is acting as if the setting and its actors are live action
558829591771480075,Rev,192,You get lots of good 1st person perspective in that episode_ and generally the camera movements feel quite natural/well-planned. And I definitely agree about the sense of 'depth' to its shots.
558829763347742779,Sen,43,the fight 2 episodes later was also amazing
558829797464342559,Sen,58,and what made me think about this a lot in the first place
558829852061466634,Sen,51,then episode 14 was itself quite a visual spectacle
558830104789123087,Legend,45,I've just rewatched that clip like 4x already
558830233881673768,Rev,243,Hm_ I think maybe the lighting and shadows help with that 'realism' feeling; obviously the art leans more toward semi-realism than it does 'cartoony'_ but the lighting_ shadows...well_ again-they feel both natural and help with sense of depth.
558830273110736896,Rev,0,
558830357764505610,Rev,81,(From episode 11 ^^ again_ because I also love the lighting used in that episode)
558830976663552030,Rev,229,(also_ that one screenshot I shared earlier of Balsa watching over Tanda(s) -- I absolutely adore that moment and screenshot it all the time whenever Moribito comes up; possibly because I adore the shot composition of that frame)
558831203134734366,Rev,141,There's depth not just in 'people'/'stage' shots (i.e scenes with lots of characters)_ but often depth to the landscape/backdrop art as well.
558831252569063475,Rev,0,
558831340460441600,Rev,115,i'm not _sure_ if that's a spoiler (the point of the screenshot is to show off the landscape art) but just in case.
558831359607701525,Rev,30,(It's from episode 11 as well)
558831641271730176,Sen,59,watching this also made me hyped up for Stand Alone Complex
558831664164241418,Sen,25,which I did not watch yet

558832680251293706,Rev,200,*I should say that I tend to appreciate Moribito's interior lighting more often; sometimes the lighting in outside scenes - particularly ones with blue skies/sunny weather - can feel a bit too bright.
558832691550748673,Durinthal,165,`Because you demanded it_ today you will finally learn the Netflix debut date of your all-time favorite anime_ Neon Genesis Evangelion. All happening at 7.00 PM PT.`

558834667239899136,Rance,447,My great-grandfather fought in Russo-Japanese war. He was a Russian cavalry officer_ so he had to kill Japanese soldiers. Washing off blood from hands is impossible_ so while he did *things with his right hand*_ the Nippon blood mixed in with his *white stuff* and so_ my grandfather was born with partial Japanese blood_ therefore making me partially Japanese and thus qualified to get isekai-d (even if that ridiculous of a requirement is true).

558834898408964127,Rev,12,i.e. 'What'.
558834957447987202,ricey_mess,50,Just started Moribito <:excite:529569461473378324>
558834980315463700,Rance,52,I'm referencing my own comment meme from months back
558835019104387093,Rev,5,Oh...
558835065182879744,Reishin,38,so you're trying to revive a dead meme
558835076490592267,carnage panda,54,I should really get to watching about these valkyries.
558835112037580821,Reishin,63,that's necromancy and qualifies as a violation of weeaboo codex
558835147345100841,Rance,27,memecromancy more like dude
558835172481564672,Rev,12,> necromancy
558835202814902309,Reishin,3,hmm
558835258921975828,Rev,89,Meanwhile_ there's a reverse isekai where the one isekai'd into Earth is a necromancer...
558835267931471893,DjBranden,150,i wonder what someone would think of EVA if you had them watch that as their first anime and then told them this is what Japanese culture is all about
558835345706188800,carnage panda,75,Is there a tread on r/anime about how disappoint people are in netflix yet?
558835387179728918,Rance,255,I got Reincarnated into another world as a Truck after being hit by a Truck to hit more people as a Truck and Reincarnate them into other worlds as Trucks so that they can break the space-time continuum and become the Truck that hit me in the first place?
558835401553346563,Durinthal,8,probably
558835403931648010,Rev,19,Isn't there always?
558835433677651999,Durinthal,40,I should check to get rid of the reposts
558835438245249024,Rance,21,new light novel title
558835574363127820,DjBranden,59,isn't Truck-kun a sort of mythological figure now in Japan?
558835764725547051,carnage panda,82,Yeah so that's about the time I'll be balls deep in all of those Symphogear shows.
558835810456305664,carnage panda,35,So I can't rewatch Evangelion then.

558840971065032715,Celes,44,Can you judge the book by the anime's cover?
558840972025397248,Xrave,236,I like the comment in one of the ep discussions that said Kemono Friends is Tatsuki applying what he wanted to tell in Kemurikusa to what he was given money to produce at the time (coz he thought he won't get funding for his brainchild)
558841087725273099,Rance,40,can you judge anime cover by anime cover
558841128120614932,Rance,37,or can you judge anime cover by anime

558847332179902504,Rance,479,So what happens when isekai protagonist doesn't die and gets transported? Isn't sudden disappearance weird or something_ like if he went into a library and never left it. There must have been cameras around and it'd at least be seen as weird right? Or disappearing right in front of a shop_ most shops have cameras that way. I want to once see isekai with "real world" scenes and people reacting to disappearance and also family dealing with the disappearance of the protagonist.

558852705372602368,ally,2,me
558852756245577739,Reishin,21,Naruto ripped of life
558852776537489410,Reishin,38,so everything feels like Naruto ripoff
558852818522341376,Reishin,11,except JoJo
558852839456243724,ally,26,naruto ripped out my heart
558852865515323392,ally,1,üíî
558852889125191690,Reishin,32,because JoJo ripped off universe
558853138111528970,Reishin,65,would Fairy Tail even have been that popular if not for the music
558853155639525447,Reishin,1,ü§î
558853184727154698,Reishin,30,well I guess manga was popular

558853299353419777,Nomeru,25,never seen any fairy tail
558853331003637760,Reishin,33,just listen to the soundtrack tbh
558853380445831198,Reishin,41,would rather watch 20 other quality anime
558853398405971988,Nomeru,99,heard years ago it was a one piece ripoff though that shouldn't really be a problem since I like OP
558853438763433985,Domefossil,50,Fun with an *amazing* soundtrack_ but not my thing
558853465854574593,Reishin,42,I;d recommend watching it for fun casually
558853495822745611,Reishin,12,dont rush it
558853505582891009,Reishin,9,not worth
558853506275082248,Domefossil,39,Had potential but kind of squandered it
558853526047162380,Nomeru,31,I don't really plan on watching
558853592321097733,„Ö†.„Ö†,113,The majority demographic of Fairy Tail are trying to block out the music so they can hear the VA's and masturbate
558853659040153622,Reishin,103,only thing I can surely say is good about FT is soundtrack and everything related to Jellal's character
558853745526702100,ally,4,lmao
558853844440842262,Reishin,15,fights are lame

558861459057147914,Nightslash (kt),63,https://twitter.com/nxonnetflix/status/1109274124088545280?s=21
558861483291967500,Rance,21,NHK was too realistic

558861561679052839,Homura,54,well manga wise 3 days of happines hit me just as hard
558861575797080105,Mendou–∫o—Çe,46,Manic Pixie Dream Girls are not that realistic
558861622295134228,Rance,3,heh
558861644269355035,Rance,34,considering it was all in his head
558861692428353536,Rance,23,source ||due to drugs||
558861726624383029,Rance,31,but it wasnt mentioned in anime
558861727018647553,Mendou–∫o—Çe,38,I mean I get how things are exagurated
558861743716040719,Homura,38,nhk ||doesn't he have scrizophrenia?||
558861788091777034,Rance,8,think so
558861793414479882,Mendou–∫o—Çe,36,but it can be real to some people ye
558861854211047454,Rance,25,it's not that unrealistic
558861869490634762,Rance,23,hallucinations are real
558861894119587850,Mendou–∫o—Çe,2,ye
558861941502640148,Rance,19,so are conspiracies
558861966790230016,Legend,33,I think I got like 7 eps into NHK
558861969046896642,Rance,47,and the most realistic part were pyramid scheme
558861980434300940,Rance,14,and such stuff
558862027138007042,Homura,33,the gamer arc was pretty realistc
558862040978948107,Rance,4,yeah
558862052085596180,Homura,28,if you look at kids nowadays
558862113024507914,Rance,35,also NHK 2nd half ||suicide stuff||

558862593947729921,Mendou–∫o—Çe,99,welcome to nhk ep 8 ||i liked that satou and misaki get carried away with their fake relationship||
558862630085984267,Homura,58,paranoia agent has a similar ep to nhk ||suicide episode||
558862716719333386,Mendou–∫o—Çe,80,ye and characters in that ep of paranoia agent are reference to tokyo godfathers
558862748432465931,Mendou–∫o—Çe,51,that's also one of the better eps of paranoia agent
558862755202072576,Rance,45,also remember that other shut in guy from NHK
558862765348093961,Mendou–∫o—Çe,37,fuck_ i should rewatch that sometimes
558862788689133601,Rance,36,that guy who ||then almost starved||

558862975872663562,Rance,28,dude had it worse than Satou
558862998135898113,Rance,3,tbh
558863014166528013,Homura,101,nhk ||yeah_ that was showing what even social anxietic people will do like get a job to survive imo||
558863064267751445,Homura,24,dude had it pretty rough
558863130642612254,Rance,35,at least Satou was able to speak up
558863181380845569,Rance,15,that guy though
558863290793459735,Homura,77,nhk ||when satou goes to school and screams was pretty cringy but realistic||
558863339342528515,Legend,53,Clicking all these cause I don't plan on finishing it
558863346296946708,Rance,31,<:pepehands:529628758924197889>
558863527771897876,LoneWolf,69,anyone here a snafu fan that can gimme a summary on the ending of s2?
558863568817094658,Rance,85,Episde 23/24 NHK ||that scene where Misaki and Satou jumped off the cliff was rough||
558863577151176725,LoneWolf,50,i rewatched the last few eps but am a bit confused
558863643463122945,Rance,22,and the backstory part
558863650929246208,TheDerped,31,<:shinocool:529569462681337856>
558863910078382083,Rance,55,NEET Samurai_ Glasses and Ginger Alien walk into a bar.

558864107777032202,Mendou–∫o—Çe,6,i mean
558864116123697162,Rance,35,I started working after watching it
558864130875064340,Mendou–∫o—Çe,25,that's not the issue here
558864135744389141,Legend,22,Just not a show for me
558864161145225219,Mendou–∫o—Çe,42,the issue is how someone got to that point
558864207378907158,Homura,61,yeah it's definetly set out to appeal to more niche audiences
558864216036212736,Mendou–∫o—Çe,56,i felt like that wasn't explored enough in the beginning
558864346562953218,Legend,120,Yeah I won't attempt to speak on the whole_ having not finished it...it just didn't do much for me in the time I gave it
558864426930012167,Homura,150,nhk ||didn't he say he did not like interacting with people? and i think he was living off parents money so no real motivation for him to find a job||
558864438921527318,Mendou–∫o—Çe,11,that's okay
558864463961260042,Rance,4,yeah
558864469564981269,Mendou–∫o—Çe,37,i don't even recommend that anime tbh
558864489743777804,Mendou–∫o—Çe,24,even tho i liked it fwiw
558864529795055653,Rance,50,also NHK ||he dropped out of university and lied||
558864683407507457,Rance,27,I wish I watched it earlier
558864703842025473,Rance,31,<:pepehands:529628758924197889>
558864743729987594,Rance,21,makes a person better
558864772578148382,Rance,13,just watch it
558865096718155796,Legend,114,Yeah_ Homura_ just like I can't recommend Rakugo to everyone...even though I want to. <:teehee:529569462416965644>
558865121036730368,Homura,7,oh yeah

558865161801170947,Legend,28,<:excite:529569461473378324>
558865813545811969,Mendou–∫o—Çe,3,heh
558865835788206090,Nomeru,28,everyone should watch rakugo
558865862598066186,Nomeru,36,continue recommending it to everyone
558865863122485260,Mendou–∫o—Çe,79,there's a rakugo club in kill la kill_ might as well tick rakugo as completed üòè
558865902712651792,Mendou–∫o—Çe,22,also_ joshiraku exists
558865918814453780,Mendou–∫o—Çe,25,isnt that about rakugo? ü§î
558866071059300399,Legend,10,Yeah it is
558866112113147916,Legend,26,Scal was watching it_ iirc
558866202407993350,Legend,71,It's so hard to sell people on it_ Nom. <:pepehands:529628758924197889>
558866296746278912,Transflection,27,Joshiraku is about "rakugo"
558866352643768320,Transflection,15,It really isn't
558866451214368768,ricey_mess,18,its the real Rakuüêê
558866465437122570,Skiptrace,74,Man_ I would hate to be in Futaro's position in Episode 10 of Quintuplets.
558866496340885525,Skiptrace,25,Yeah_ I know_ i'm behind.
558866563923705866,Transflection,135,It's more of a weird_ meta comedy anime with a lot of reference that will fly over your head if you don't understand Japan at that time
558866571926306827,Transflection,11,Which is eh
558866581329805312,Transflection,10,I liked it
558866587382317076,Transflection,5,A lot
558866675055722496,Legend,91,That's what scal said too more or less. I haven't seen it so <:yuishrug:529569462207250433>
558866752214401034,Transflection,18,The ED is a banger
558866761395470357,ricey_mess,23,hows Release the Spyce?
558866783629606913,Transflection,9,It's aite
558866833755734057,Transflection,54,Probably one of the better original anime I've watched
558867250686459945,Transflection,73,There may or may not be a pacing issue but <:yuishrug:529569462207250433>
558867303878492171,Transflection,53,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QowyHrJWAjM Goes hard
558867643076050945,Legend,3,Lol
558867658200580106,Bulju,39,I thought it was completely forgettable
558867664861134848,Bulju,7,At best
558867680984039425,Legend,46,scal posted that too <:LUL:529569462752641034>
558868175354200074,Nosferatu,32,someone already pointed this out
558868242526109739,Nosferatu,47,but its unlikely domestic will get second seson
558868259995385856,Nosferatu,6,season
558868339699613704,Nosferatu,63,this looks like a classic anime fully promoting the manga thing
558868437817098250,Nosferatu,52,plus i hear diomeda doesn't really do second seasons
558868649314615296,Nosferatu,45,plus i hear this was a really poor adaptation
558868682399416331,Nosferatu,28,makes so much sense now lmao
558868875651842048,Bulju,74,I'll tell you what I'm looking forward to thoNLhttps://youtu.be/0gFyPLriOcM
558868907364974592,Bulju,65,Release the Spyce_ but good <:GWlulurdMegaLul:402868018721456128>

558869394298634251,Lotusberry,32,Do you like it that much or what
558869503350407181,Bulju,24,Wait Blackfox is a movie
558869514381688842,Bulju,5,FUUUU
558869585382604803,LoneWolf,69,domestic has been the first manga ive actually stayed up late reading
558869613681704960,LoneWolf,28,so yeah i liked it that much
558869641309585439,LoneWolf,14,i aint ashamed
558869741473759233,LoneWolf,73,the fact that theres no s2_ is like taking a falcon punch to the dick tho
558869774545977354,Nosferatu,19,its honestly genius
558869830204129295,Nosferatu,29,diomeda sucks ass as a studio
558869854199742484,LoneWolf,28,its genius but its so scummy
558869929575710731,Transflection,66,Scum's Wish sequel adaptation when <:pepehands:529628758924197889>
558869944893177867,Nosferatu,78,so it makes so much sense to just make a crappy s1 to get people to read manga
558869966636449792,Nosferatu,19,and it fucking word
558870017429602332,Nosferatu,6,worked
558870077328588801,Lotusberry,81,Don't remember the ending all that well but how would a sequel for that even work
558870156655329281,Transflection,51,I mean_ I think it adapted everything the manga had
558870169418596362,Transflection,17,For the most part
558870201416941588,Transflection,44,But the author came out with a sequel series
558870260321878017,Transflection,48,Like 7-10 years after the events of the original
558870630221611008,Lotusberry,84,<:GWsetmyxPeepoWeird:405337568155009024> Idk if I'd even want to read that but neato
558871082644406314,Transflection,21,It sounds interesting
558871813552209952,Bulju,30,Blackfox is a movie apparently
558871856707272704,Bulju,34,I was really looking forward to it

558872458443227136,LoneWolf,39,so which of the airing anime is 2-cour?
558872574088577058,vetro,121,They changed it from a tv series to a movie. There will also be a live action companion show to air around the same time.

558994123407753230,Ahenshihael,28,out of all bleach characters
558994155380932628,Ahenshihael,59,beating even MC which is very unusual for shonen demo works
558994184086880267,Sen,61,so Kubo made some art of the characters after the manga ended
558994227552452618,Angst-Incarnate,95,If his top two ships aren't Stevie Wonder and Air Bud then the fujos ain't even watch the show.
558994241074757646,Ahenshihael,24,Kira is also popular-ish
558994251913101312,Sen,68,turns out Orihime transformed into a hentai ara ara ultra thicc milf

558994388731166730,Roak,31,she was pretty much always that
558994417051238411,Roak,32,and its actually kinda gross lol
558994440816033822,Roak,40,well not always but like halfway through
558994448998989834,Ahenshihael,53,I mean_ yes she was but (Bleach) || She got hotter ||
558994453592014869,Sen,39,nah_ you don't know her post manga look

558994530477539338,Sen,43,she legit looks straight out of milf hentai
558994555521859584,Roak,9,yeah lmao
558994565093392395,Sen,21,she went full ara ara
558994572638945301,Roak,23,not a good look for her
558994601336111105,Sen,14,fully disagree
558994727211368459,Roak,84,im not against big tiddy milf girls by principle but she just does not look good imo
558994750288691201,Ahenshihael,72,she's the most consistent looking character after Ichigo in bleach tho ü§∑
558994788590944257,Roak,8,lol yeah
558994843981053965,Xalgoz,13,I have to see
558994880668631040,Sen,21,let me look it up xal
558994893071187978,Sen,15,and I'll DM you
558994939141160991,Roak,45,you could put it in <#343425038864875520> too
558994961211588619,Angst-Incarnate,116,Ulq saw the future and said he ain't about that life ||faded into dust|| before he could get crushed by milftiddies.
558994995667927041,Roak,3,LOL
558995047597473802,Sen,45,alright_ whoever wants to see it_ go to ecchi
558995149041041409,Roak,19,ulq was the... 4th?
558995196826746899,Ahenshihael,12,the emo boye
558995231438274583,Sen,27,imagine not remembering Ulq
558995259707621377,Angst-Incarnate,3,Yup
558995286379200512,Sen,31,when did you watch Bleach Reef?
558995323075166228,Ahenshihael,81,but yeah_ overall bleach ending character designs all were a huge improvement tbh
558995355723890698,Ahenshihael,58,unlike some other shonen manga where it makes you go "wut"
558995413613412371,Ahenshihael,80,all the changes made  sense in terms of characters and everybody looked fine  af
558995460208066560,Sen,23,especially milf orihime
558995619042033664,Sen,17,kubo went all out
558995650411495434,Sen,43,even her choice of swimsuit is hentai level
558995743096963091,Ahenshihael,88,and I mean that ecchi image is not that different from (bleach)  || her ending design ||
558995807617941515,Ahenshihael,46,I'd say that one is still the superior version
558995893735522306,Ahenshihael,15,(bleach ending)
558995903386746901,Ahenshihael,22,this is still top tier
558995929064275988,Ahenshihael,31,as far as design evolution goes
558995934076207104,Ahenshihael,31,<:GWumuSmug:399090735607185418>
558995968444596244,Sen,27,this lacks the ara ara look
558995988560347147,Roak,11,much better
558995995195867136,Sen,34,which makes any thicc waifu better
558996013638090767,Xalgoz,20,Yeah that looks fine
558996022781804544,REAMS,11,pretty cute
558996068306649128,REAMS,12,no Yoruichi?
558996074845437973,Angst-Incarnate,218,I didn't care for Uryu's look in TYBW_ he looks way too serious_ I actually think his design gets subtly worse as the series goes on because he starts having asymmetric Skrillex hair and his bow gets less cool as well.
558996164825841664,Ahenshihael,28,eh_ its fitting look for him
558996197092753419,rcmaehl,2,No

558996259323510794,Xalgoz,86,Better than Hinata anyway. Hinata got hit with the nerf bat of plainess with her look.
558996274037391360,Roak,11,do you mind
558996313841205259,Sen,31,reef_ when did you watch bleach
558996416312246272,Angst-Incarnate,45,That's just the Boruto artist being ass_ Xal.

559031033799114773,Standed,25,I haven‚Äôt read the novels
559031087083290654,Rev,194,But in reading the first few volumes (that the anime adapted) I realized they kinda made him a bit more shounen protagy then he actually is in those novels. 1930!Firo in the LNs is a little shit

559032324394582031,Rev,170,I wasn't invested in the Netflix announcement in the first place_ but I get being ticked that the countdown amounted to an announcement of a future date and nothing more.
559032442011254802,Rev,63,That trailer seemed to be painting NGE as an action show too...
559032727370727446,StrayCatPotato,44,Tbh i just want an excuse to watch eva again
559032956786704384,Rev,102,Haha_ I get it. Much of that lack of investment on my part was due to the fact I don't have Netflix...
