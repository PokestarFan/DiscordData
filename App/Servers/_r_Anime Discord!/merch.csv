558441740453806081,hellkite91,1052,Sup_ had a question bout buying the I want to eat your Pancreas anime film Blu Ray that's coming out soon. If this isn't the right channel_ lemme know where I should be posting. Thanks.NLNLhttps://kimisui-anime.com/bddvd/NLNL1. What's the preferred proxy buying service for getting preorders from TSUTAYA online? I like their limited edition goodies the best_ but dont know which service is ideal. shipping will be to USA.NLNL2. looking for a sanity check_ cuz im relying on google translate. The common book cover and clear bookmark set is just for the plain limited edition or has to be from that fancy exclusive limited edition that some stores are offering? I looked at the amazon.jp listings for both the regular limited edition and their exclusive limited edition. Only the exclusive one mentions the book cover set in the title and has a pic of it. But neither of them explicitly list that piece of merchandise in the product content description. I'd link the page for each item_ but the urls are hella long and idk if link shorteners are allowed here
558441785727123476,Roak,4,well
558441799278919720,Roak,17,my first question
558441821823434762,Roak,42,is why wouldnt you wait for the us release
558442002031575051,hellkite91,128,damn u read fast. i want the goodies. and considering there's no annoucnement date yet even for the NA one_ i wanna buy this now
558442548343996426,Roak,17,oh okay fair shot
558442567687995392,Roak,8,uhhhhhhh
558442612944666654,Roak,31,amazon's listings are truly ass
558446303219154965,hellkite91,252,ok ignore the question bout the book cover set. just reread the description on the anime website_ and it's only the amazon exclusive limited version that gets it. still looking for help on finding a proxy service website to preorder from TSUTAYA online
558446786465759252,donavannj,14,idk about best
558446924139593730,donavannj,79,actually wait it is a proxy buy service not just a proxy ship service_ correct?
558447148082135050,hellkite91,79,ive never used a proxy service before so im honestly really clueless about this
558447326880858113,donavannj,84,you *may* be able to get away with a forwarding service if you buy through amazon.jp
558447425174503424,donavannj,116,actually make even be able to get away with just straight up buying it through amazon.jp if it's sold by Amazon iirc
558447526861340674,hellkite91,102,amazon.jp is no problem_ the item offers shipping straight to US. I just like tsutaya's goodies better
558447790699839488,donavannj,116,any should work_ but the ones people I know have used or that I've used myself are DEJAPAN_ FromJapan_ and ZenMarket
558447888775118858,donavannj,35,ZenMarket tends to have higher fees
558448132766040078,hellkite91,199,how much should i expect to pay for all the shipping and middleman fees. you wouldn't happen to know? i do like the goodies_ but not if it's gonna cost like way more than getting straight from amazon
558448186075643904,donavannj,26,depends on the proxy buyer
558448295333199912,donavannj,44,my guess is probably under $30 easily though
558448328384315403,donavannj,18,probably even less
558448351008260117,hellkite91,27,ok i can handle another $30
558448399087566849,donavannj,64,gimme a sec while I go look up my fees for my last zenmarket buy
558448807738867713,donavannj,57,okay yeah i paid 300 yen per item purchased in commission
558449042821087233,hellkite91,92,u had to pay for both shipping the item to zen market and then them shipping it to u_ right?
558449062295240704,donavannj,3,yep
558449086148116480,donavannj,34,shipping to zen market was 324 yen
558449158378487809,donavannj,47,shipping to me was EMS only due to package size
558449197536509968,donavannj,33,3700 yen because it was nesoberis
558449202712018975,hellkite91,13,u live in US?
558449213185196033,donavannj,3,yes
558449244218982401,donavannj,22,Minnesota specifically
558449364545044490,hellkite91,101,alright. ill dig around. looked at zen market_ doesnt look like they got it_ so ill try the other two
558449425714905088,donavannj,63,all the services should be able to work with a link you provide
558449435160477710,donavannj,18,and order the item
558449518488846346,donavannj,37,that's what i had to do with my items
558449688022351882,donavannj,107,they will tell you if the retailer doesn't like selling to proxy buy services iirc_ usually by email though
558449825826209813,donavannj,108,here's your item page link: http://shop.tsutaya.co.jp/dvd/product/4515778101263/?sc_int=dvd_pc_center-pickup
558450003576619019,hellkite91,0,
558450040004411393,hellkite91,51,it shows me this when i pasted and searched the url
558450072162009101,hellkite91,19,idk if it's working
558450395555299341,donavannj,41,it's looking for you to describe the item
558450445073514497,donavannj,63,to ensure they get the right thing when they go shopping for it
558450565810749451,donavannj,48,and then you click add to add it to the buy list
558450786489860156,hellkite91,81,i made a description and clicked add. it brought me to like their how to use page
558450787555213355,donavannj,62,they will check item availability overnight and then email you
558450843272347679,hellkite91,44,oh ok. I guess i gotta make an account first
558450971164803083,donavannj,8,yeah lol
558450995563069461,hellkite91,32,u know any promo codes for them?
558451039519637514,hellkite91,36,i see the option in account creation
558451062080798721,donavannj,78,completely missed the signs you hadn't signed upNLNLNLuh not that i can think of?
558451122755469362,donavannj,70,i signed up with one back in the fall but i've completely forgotten it
558451215789457429,hellkite91,12,ok no biggie
558451272022228992,donavannj,38,it was only a 300 yen promotion anyway
558451306088497172,donavannj,36,also zenmarket works by adding funds
558451362497822720,donavannj,69,and i think there's a fee for converting your cash to zenmarket funds
558451407372419082,donavannj,52,so that's part of why people don't use it as readily
558451536418701322,donavannj,86,i used zenmarket because the items i wanted had a capped purchase quantity per address
558451594782441472,hellkite91,8,wait wut
558451636800978995,hellkite91,53,i cant just straight up pay? i gotta buy funny money?
558451729549492225,hellkite91,35,and that funny money isnt even 1:1?
558451909652905994,donavannj,81,iircNLNLthough i'm not seeing any fund add fees in my payment history on my account
558451944805367820,donavannj,36,so I *could* be remembering it wrong
558452077320470538,donavannj,77,i haven't used the other two services so i'm not sure how *they* work in full
558452121876430878,donavannj,51,but there's not much I've had to actually proxy buy
558452232358461487,donavannj,95,mostly only forwarding and the things I've bought via forwarding started getting stocked by TOM
558452297668100126,hellkite91,144,if it wasnt for the fact that id prolly never have a use for that stainless steel water bottle_ id prolly be too lazy to use a proxy service too
558452465188470794,hellkite91,36,and just straight buy from amazon.jp
558452602732281868,donavannj,29,actually i forgot about Buyee
558452741102632960,donavannj,121,i think  most people i chat with on other servers use Buyee first_ then check DEJAPAN_ then FromJapan_ and then ZenMarket
558452793116065813,donavannj,45,check out the fees for each before committing
558453058896658437,hellkite91,41,yeah ill research those. thx for the help
558453187292430337,hellkite91,127,looking at buyee right now. i already hate them. ive stared at this page for  like a minute still cant find the damn search bar
558453203545489419,donavannj,64,if zenmarket's your only option_ then that's the way things roll
558453268301479938,donavannj,31,there isn't one on the homepage
558453624334974997,hellkite91,67,bleh. alright thx. i think i just gotta do the searching myself now
558453670329450519,donavannj,23,okay buyee has a plugin
558453690906705931,donavannj,19,called add to buyee
558453750490988545,donavannj,44,and that's how you do the buying apparently?
558453944830132232,donavannj,44,at least for sites not on their list already
558453991105757192,hellkite91,5,oh ok
558454395197456394,donavannj,111,just tested and that works for tsutayaNLNLso that's good newsNLNLhappy shoppingNLNLdon't destroy your wallet too hard
558454713939656722,hellkite91,10,thx friend
558769412690280471,donavannj,89,i'd stick to just using Nippon-Yasan for old figures you can't find elsewhere_ personally
558771900453748768,saltyDAN,28,That has to be pricing error
558794745149915166,SentientTurtle,58,`That has to be a pricing error`NLI'm absolutely sure it is
558794792939552778,SentientTurtle,57,Given it's close to exactly 10% of the conventional price
558794954059546626,SentientTurtle,75,Hence I warned people that NY is very unlikely to honor such pricing errors
558796308199112728,SentientTurtle,174,Still not sure if I want to risk a pre-order on that figure in general_ considering FOTS hasn't made a correction yet on if they are or are not using their newer plastic type
558827557332582419,scalizo,26,def dropped a 0 there lmao
558833330632523777,SentientTurtle,49,What amuses me is that it's been up for hours now
558833379005693980,SentientTurtle,59,_Pushing updates on a friday? What could possibly go wrong_
