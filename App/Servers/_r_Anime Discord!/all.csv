558436763924955156,Sir Hatsley,anime,15,legit this time
558436787312263189,Sir Hatsley,anime,44,unlike karekano where he never actually left
558436793712771082,snowwhistle,anime,114,Hot take... I don't think the Island arc is quite as bad (sans 3 or 4 specific episodes) as most people say it is.
558436824574459916,Sir Hatsley,anime,49,but nadia flunks so hard it can never recover tbh
558436837929123850,Roak,anime,21,thats a good idea nom
558436857537626119,scalizo,manga,65,can't say i'm a fan at all of this most recent kaguya development
558436858829209610,Sir Hatsley,anime,47,i also really didnt like the final arc of nadia
558436897089912834,Sen,anime,43,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0n-9X1MuMQ
558436939762630668,scalizo,manga,91,i hate it and it just feels like a massively unnecessary stepback for god knows what reason
558436950848045057,snowwhistle,anime,142,Anno didn't leave Nadia. He was so busy working on the final five episodes that he had to leave episodes 23-34 with his friend Shinji Higuchi.

558437170520522782,Brother Spicy,anime,28,That might be a watch for me
558437183552356352,Sir Hatsley,anime,30,wait island arc was higuchi???
558437222462783499,Sir Hatsley,anime,37,higuchi as in... dragon pilot higuchi
558437234085199890,Sir Hatsley,anime,23,so thats why its so bad
558437243107147787,Thrashinuva,anime,68,I'll stick with this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0z08OpmEPc
558437259737563137,Sir Hatsley,anime,43,at least anno knows that island arc was bad
558437285679464459,Roak,anime,29,NAAAAAAAAKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
558437295171305483,Sir Hatsley,anime,55,and he edited them out of the show in his recut version
558437342356963328,snowwhistle,anime,45,I will defend episode 30 and 31 to the grave.

558437590542450699,Sen,anime,44,I hear they went ahead and changed the plot?
558437598998167602,snowwhistle,anime,182,Also_ despite the Island arc being a big mess there's little scenes in it that I did like. I could see the Island Arc being reedited into 3 or 4 episodes and being a serviceable arc.
558437615859269642,Sen,anime,18,that's a big no no
558437658175733770,Sir Hatsley,anime,39,i mean_ the claims arent fake and wrong
558437662940463115,Krauzer,games,48,I love PC Gaming and I'll protect it to the END!
558437675221254197,Sir Hatsley,anime,26,and the movie is still bad
558437681714036737,Roak,anime,50,gits with no transhumanism themes is no gits to me
558437685098840092,Thrashinuva,anime,35,the plots kind of condensed version

558437723942420511,Thrashinuva,anime,54,and they are fake and wrong_ there was no whitewashing
558437729877360640,Sir Hatsley,anime,20,transhumanism is dum
558437756695609344,Roak,anime,36,transhumanism is fucking fascinating
558437766011027456,Roak,anime,16,also please stop
558437817089523723,Sir Hatsley,anime,31,you know my thoughts on it reef
558437859686744094,Roak,anime,42,1) this should be in <#378707055327969300>
558437864141225995,Sir Hatsley,anime,21,if you dont_ ask sami
558437877554610177,Roak,anime,32,2) check the channel topic there
558437926791544832,snowwhistle,anime,121,I've only ever seen the anime film version of GITS_ but I thought it had some fascinating ideas outside of transhumanism.
558437933854621696,Roak,anime,0,
558437946445791266,Sir Hatsley,anime,75,i've already seen enough toxic takes to just block the new Less Cool thrash

558438082353954816,Sen,anime,47,you need to watch Vampire Hunter D and Bloolust
558438105439272970,Sir Hatsley,anime,10,hell yeah!
558438120257880064,Sir Hatsley,anime,13,kawajiri baby
558438130823462922,Roak,anime,93,my real thoughts are more like gits without nerdy humanism themes and technobabble is no gits
558438174792220672,Roak,anime,41,havent seen anything from kawajiri either
558438210527690792,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),anime,84,"need to" is a little much for vampire hunter d. it's a good movie_ but need to? nah
558438253590478880,Sir Hatsley,anime,43,kawajiri is not for u if you hate gobslayer
558438256031825930,Sir Hatsley,anime,3,but
558438260637171742,Sir Hatsley,anime,8,its also
558438265573867533,Sir Hatsley,anime,7,so good
558438300105441282,Sen,anime,46,the visuals in bloodlust are on fucking poinyt
558438319802023957,Sir Hatsley,anime,27,i like wicked city the most
558438352660201473,Roak,anime,80,well i hate goblin slayer for plot reasons and not for visual or tone reasons so
558438371282780162,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),anime,58,it looks nice yeah_ but not enough to call it a must watch
558438376336916531,Roak,anime,21,does that still apply
558438453843460096,Sir Hatsley,anime,50,kawajiri has many scenes depicting sexual violence
558438477595672602,snowwhistle,anime,108,Goblin Slayer is fine. It's nothing special_ but I found it entertaining isekai trash with some funny lines.
558438477986004993,Roak,anime,19,yeah im cool w that
558438481517477908,Sir Hatsley,anime,32,in every single one of his works

558438718147526657,Brother Spicy,anime,111,Goblin slayer is just interesting because I hadn’t seen dark fantasy much before that wasn’t SUPER over the top
558438788926537753,snowwhistle,anime,115,I've just begun to associate all fantasy anime with isekai because 90% of the time now if it's fantasy it's isekai.
558438795146559498,Brother Spicy,anime,26,like hellsing or something

558439137300971521,Brother Spicy,anime,45,No rape ever in D&D books from my estimation?
558439166162239499,Brother Spicy,anime,33,or the heroes being in real peril
558439182595260426,Thrashinuva,anime,115,I wouldn't consider that politics otherwise I wouldn't have mentioned it_ it's either a claim that is true or isn't

558439389538287636,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),anime,75,there's enough sexual violence in FR. there doesnt need to be explicit rape
558439482630864908,Roak,anime,113,pretty obvious what kind of controversy we're talking about here_ please stop discussing this and move on_ thanks
558439633655037966,Durinthal,anime,110,I'm tempted to watch Interstella again based solely on seeing the characters in <#268515018897620995> just now
558439644375547915,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),anime,88,gore and explicit violence of any kind are rarely necessary. it's mostly used to be edgy

558439731310886913,Thrashinuva,anime,157,hey look_ okay_ I follow rules_ but to be completely honest with the kind of reaction here_ I'm not sure I actually know what controversy we're talking about
558439732741275662,Sen,anime,338,the irony is that rape is a huge genre in doujins which are very popular among anime fans yet when it happens in a show all of a sudden everyone is like "oh noes_ why did they sexualize this_ can't handle it_ gonna faint" Edit: already finished writing this before you said move on_ so gonna leave it as my final reply_ don't kill me Beef
558439767746936840,Roak,anime,29,being reminded that it exists
558439798050783243,Roak,anime,38,nah thats not what i was talking about

558441740453806081,hellkite91,merch,1052,Sup_ had a question bout buying the I want to eat your Pancreas anime film Blu Ray that's coming out soon. If this isn't the right channel_ lemme know where I should be posting. Thanks.NLNLhttps://kimisui-anime.com/bddvd/NLNL1. What's the preferred proxy buying service for getting preorders from TSUTAYA online? I like their limited edition goodies the best_ but dont know which service is ideal. shipping will be to USA.NLNL2. looking for a sanity check_ cuz im relying on google translate. The common book cover and clear bookmark set is just for the plain limited edition or has to be from that fancy exclusive limited edition that some stores are offering? I looked at the amazon.jp listings for both the regular limited edition and their exclusive limited edition. Only the exclusive one mentions the book cover set in the title and has a pic of it. But neither of them explicitly list that piece of merchandise in the product content description. I'd link the page for each item_ but the urls are hella long and idk if link shorteners are allowed here
558441753754075136,Krauzer,games,47,Bc I got plenty of games and don't need to rush
558441768547516436,Czar,general,42,It’s just every server is talking about it

558442065503977472,Sacchi,anime,64,Yeah. I'm also assuming hair color_ voice and stuff is the same.
558442180960845844,Durinthal,anime,61,other three would be fairly similar if not styled differently
558442248610775070,Sacchi,anime,26,There is also the hairpin.

558449158378487809,donavannj,merch,47,shipping to me was EMS only due to package size
558449172458504192,ricey_mess,casual,96,Sea cucumbers are echinoderms btw_ related to sea urchines_ star fish_ sand dollars and all that
558449197536509968,donavannj,merch,33,3700 yen because it was nesoberis

558450923236622339,Nomeru,anime,108,votoms ||they were in love_ torn apart by war_ and ended up in a fight to the death_ one killing the other||
558450958963834902,Roak,anime,9,two guys?

558451122755469362,donavannj,merch,70,i signed up with one back in the fall but i've completely forgotten it
558451215789457429,hellkite91,merch,12,ok no biggie
558451272022228992,donavannj,merch,38,it was only a 300 yen promotion anyway
558451306088497172,donavannj,merch,36,also zenmarket works by adding funds
558451333812715530,Von,recommendations,9,Ty mate ❤
558451335603945487,Ravenlift,anime,166,Hey guys could I get your help? I'm not sure if this quite goes under the anime tab but hopefully this'll be fine you guys are the only group active right now anyway.
558451362497822720,donavannj,merch,69,and i think there's a fee for converting your cash to zenmarket funds
558451407372419082,donavannj,merch,52,so that's part of why people don't use it as readily
558451512833998880,Ravenlift,anime,87,I'm working on fanart of Lancer and wanna see what to change before I start to color it
558451536418701322,donavannj,merch,86,i used zenmarket because the items i wanted had a capped purchase quantity per address
558451594782441472,hellkite91,merch,8,wait wut

558451872898351124,Nomeru,anime,145,yeah <#269247167019876352> would be the place to post that and discuss it. that said I'm sure there's people here that can give some useful input
558451909652905994,donavannj,merch,81,iircNLNLthough i'm not seeing any fund add fees in my payment history on my account
558451944805367820,donavannj,merch,36,so I *could* be remembering it wrong
558452077320470538,donavannj,merch,77,i haven't used the other two services so i'm not sure how *they* work in full
558452121876430878,donavannj,merch,51,but there's not much I've had to actually proxy buy
558452185139249162,Ravenlift,anime,118,Yeah_ I didn't want to post there because the last time anyone was active was 2-3 hours ago and I'm drawing right now😅
558452232358461487,donavannj,merch,95,mostly only forwarding and the things I've bought via forwarding started getting stocked by TOM

558452297668100126,hellkite91,merch,144,if it wasnt for the fact that id prolly never have a use for that stainless steel water bottle_ id prolly be too lazy to use a proxy service too
558452358544097292,Nomeru,anime,113,well you brought it to people's attention here. If there are people interested in helping they can go over therre

558757474635874315,ricey_mess,recommendations,29,Ah_ I thought it was funny af
558757827871637532,Twat,recommendations,170,>most of cast gets naked NL>New character is shocked and starts freaking outNL>One of the female cast members says something along the lines of "I hate that I'm used to it"
558757849908641794,Rev,anime,29,What about Fate/strange fake?
558757858838183937,GreatestSaltboy,anime,24,damn rev why you do this
558757878748676106,Durinthal,anime,26,if only there was an anime
558757916824305674,Twat,recommendations,38,Now I can see how some find that funny
558757930103603211,Birb,games,113,Well then_ having a literally one-shot attack with hitbox twice bigger than the weapon model is a giant cunt move
558757953486716944,Durinthal,anime,39,IIRC that's the spinoff set in America?
558757957001543692,Birb,games,32,classic fromsoftware experience.
558757976777949194,Rev,anime,16,Yeah_ by Narita.
558758040728371200,Rev,anime,98,Nasu gave him feedback on it and everything; isn't the idea of Fate that most things can be canon?
558758048638959628,Twat,recommendations,83,But to me I just didn't get it because I could predict when it was going to come up
558758080645693456,Durinthal,anime,42,don't remember if it's a separate timeline
558758133275688985,Burnz,general,46,<@283818835067273226> Before anyone exposes me
558758219992924202,Rev,anime,109,I think F/sf is definitely after Fate/Zero_ at least. I know some people were trying to fit it on a timeline.

558758327018979339,Durinthal,anime,130,IIRC the main canon is Zero -> Stay Night (all of it) -> Hollow Ataraxia -> Grand OrderNLbut I don't remember where I got that from

558758627134144523,GreatestSaltboy,anime,81,maybe apo before go too because it has characters from there play important roles
558758705479286784,Rev,anime,49,"why you do this" // because Narita is a calling.
558758869908586515,Rev,anime,201,Also because_ though I'm not someone who's actually into/experienced Fate proper_ I know that f/sf is well-liked so far by fate fans both in and outside of Japan. (also Vol 5 is coming out next month).

558765557147762698,Ratchet,tech,195,it's been about a week since this happened but I've been afraid to do anything on this PC out of fear that it'll happen again. I've tried to replicate things somewhat but it hasn't happened next.

558766516687077393,Ratchet,tech,45,error 41 likely happened as a result of that?

558767118372569089,Bernas,tech,124,memtest is the safest bet_ especially doing one at a time. could also be a OS thing in which case a clean wipe should fix it

558784534955425794,Tea4Dragons,anime,104,well studio Satelight being the one adapting it says a lot to why it looks bad but has great backgrounds
558784549715443724,Jean,anime,53,Did someone inherit the novels after the author died?
558784589053820928,Nomeru,anime,110,does that mean they did character design for the novels_ or they did character design for new anime characters

558785333924462595,piippon,games,87,and it's by far the slowest save for DeS_ but DeS has far longer and unforgiving levels

558785557874868224,Tea4Dragons,anime,26,130 volumes seems too much

558785693313138690,Nomeru,anime,44,so they did release 5 volumes after she died
558785731380641822,Nomeru,anime,22,sounds pretty done now
558785801228648463,Nomeru,anime,6,or not

558789989224284160,Sen,anime,83,is this a reinterpretation or something? or no longer human has always been sci fi?
558790016596180992,Sen,anime,17,had no idea if so
558790079984959509,Sky King,anime,49,A little bit unrelated but_ having never seen HxH
558790125182517249,Sir Hatsley,anime,14,It's not scifi
558790137170100224,Sky King,anime,54,I never realized how much in common it has with Naruto
558790168723587082,Sky King,anime,13,Nen -> Chakra

558790266786676748,Homura,anime,26,i don't see the comparison

558790336122585099,carnage panda,anime,41,Is there a character named Itachi in HxH?
558790352580902953,Sky King,anime,40,Not digging into the themese or whatever
558790355437223953,Sen,anime,42,lighting abilities were invented by naruto

558790465369931793,Sky King,anime,23,Yep I'm getting roasted
558790478649098270,Sky King,anime,10,delet this
558790554381713458,Zaboru,games,285,for the runback to the bull you can just go right side up the wall where i think the first group of 2 enemies is and then grapple on top and drop down onto the 2 guys in front of the bull room_ that way those 2 and the guys in the bull room are the only ones you'll have to worry about
558790617635880960,Levitacus,anime,90,That's what happens when you say stupid things <:GWaobloChildPepeShrug:407618817569718272>

558790702008369153,Sky King,anime,83,Ok but the comparison between magic and chakra is way different than nen and chakra
558790740784971818,Twat,memes,0,
558790767464939520,Sky King,anime,63,Nen and chakra both have the fundamental life force thing going

558807356390244413,PokeM,casual,177,Which of course means limited supply and those preorders get sold out quickly. Most of the time its scalpers buying them in bulk and charging up towards 300% off original price.

558827713977122857,Sen,anime,69,there's something else to moribito_ I think it's the shot composition
558827747556720650,Sen,anime,22,there's a lot of depth
558827859192446986,Sen,anime,87,when characters interact with the environment it really feels 3d and appropriately wide
558827892533100574,Sen,anime,55,for example when there's a serious fight in a big field

558829098072276993,Sen,anime,81,it's a mystery why this show is so under-watched and barely talked about nowadays
558829148777349120,Rev,anime,180,If we look at Episode 11_ my fav Moribito episode mentioned earlier...in that episode_ it sort of feels like the 'camera' is acting as if the setting and its actors are live action
558829354335862786,Bendydick Cumbersniff,casual,13,just me then?
558829591771480075,Rev,anime,192,You get lots of good 1st person perspective in that episode_ and generally the camera movements feel quite natural/well-planned. And I definitely agree about the sense of 'depth' to its shots.
558829763347742779,Sen,anime,43,the fight 2 episodes later was also amazing
558829797464342559,Sen,anime,58,and what made me think about this a lot in the first place
558829852061466634,Sen,anime,51,then episode 14 was itself quite a visual spectacle
558830104789123087,Legend,anime,45,I've just rewatched that clip like 4x already
558830233881673768,Rev,anime,243,Hm_ I think maybe the lighting and shadows help with that 'realism' feeling; obviously the art leans more toward semi-realism than it does 'cartoony'_ but the lighting_ shadows...well_ again-they feel both natural and help with sense of depth.

558831076915675157,ZeXm,manga,11,pretty good
558831203134734366,Rev,anime,141,There's depth not just in 'people'/'stage' shots (i.e scenes with lots of characters)_ but often depth to the landscape/backdrop art as well.

558832680251293706,Rev,anime,200,*I should say that I tend to appreciate Moribito's interior lighting more often; sometimes the lighting in outside scenes - particularly ones with blue skies/sunny weather - can feel a bit too bright.

558847332179902504,Rance,anime,479,So what happens when isekai protagonist doesn't die and gets transported? Isn't sudden disappearance weird or something_ like if he went into a library and never left it. There must have been cameras around and it'd at least be seen as weird right? Or disappearing right in front of a shop_ most shops have cameras that way. I want to once see isekai with "real world" scenes and people reacting to disappearance and also family dealing with the disappearance of the protagonist.

559099931265073202,Pangolin,anime,17,Season 2 was okay
559100016556507139,Roak,anime,95,alicization ||the one that ends on kirito and synthesis knight eugeo meeting in the top floor||

559100170625876015,Ahenshihael,anime,7,MR is 👌
559100229077565460,Roak,anime,76,im sure regulars of this channel know just how much i loved mother's rosario
559100231707525130,Ahenshihael,anime,134,alicization has flaws but at least it spends decent  amount of time on characters and has some of best fight animations to date in sao
559100264263712799,Non,anime,24,Any Sakurasou fans here?
559100269703593992,Roak,anime,7,(a lot)

559100436356005909,Ahenshihael,anime,33,all I know about it is the title_
559100438071476234,Maelstrom,anime,36,I'm only a fan of Asuna's bath scene
559100455154745357,Ahenshihael,anime,44,I'm happy not knowing anything else about it

559100484795760640,Roak,anime,28,did you like bunny girl ahen
559100552550547477,Ahenshihael,anime,69,it was okay thing to tide me over till next gatari but nothing more 🤷
559100573807542292,Roak,anime,2,ah
559100617021325313,Roak,anime,36,well sakurasou has a lot of Problems
559100635400634394,araneaesGrasp,anime,11,Kamoshida 💤
559100647560183809,Non,anime,39,BGS was good (same author as Sakurasou)
559100659006177289,Non,anime,4,Yeah
559100708742365185,Ahenshihael,anime,118,it had some nice banter but the moment I'd try to pick it apart _ the show would most likely fall apart(unlike gatari)
559100741956927488,Ahenshihael,anime,49,also_ bunny's MC is nowhere near ararararagi_ sry
559100744754528273,Angst-Incarnate,anime,93,Bunny Girl is better than Sakurasou but that's like going from eating razors to eating paper.
559100748718407702,CritSrc,anime,42,I've completely forgotten about Bunny Girl
559100816451960832,Roak,anime,142,there's this one character that's essentially just like the mc of bunny girl_ but the show doesn't want him to mature and keeps him an asshole
559100827038384156,Roak,anime,10,and my god
559100843035721728,Roak,anime,23,my god is he an asshole
559100842196598784,Ahenshihael,anime,3,oof
559100861826072604,Non,anime,43,Sakurasou is moe about the after effect tho
559100904125759508,Roak,anime,21,talking about jin btw
559100933519310883,Non,anime,68,It's probably the only anime I rated higher a week after watching it
559100964402102312,Ahenshihael,anime,149,I mean even bunny's MC felt like its basically "I want to write Kyon but without any sort of thought behind it so let's just make him a snarky dude "
559100987500134433,Non,anime,24,Jin is a walking tragedy
559101008999874606,Roak,anime,36,yeah imo its the wrong kind of snark
559101062729039873,Ahenshihael,anime,98,which hey_ gave some great dialogue with other characters_ but  on his own he's nobody interesting
559101075605553172,Sen,anime,22,and Mai is for doujins
559101119113199637,Ahenshihael,anime,80,I can see how that kind of shit can be incredibly annoying if written even worse
559101120405045273,Roak,anime,32,<:WeirdChamp:557226763395006466>
559101142324477986,Non,anime,69,I liked Kaede but apart from it it somewhat felt like a generic harem
559101217071169546,Non,anime,35,I hate the imouto in Sakurasouu btw
559101233668030464,araneaesGrasp,anime,94,I didn't even care for the interactions because the voice acting was so dull with him and Mai.
559101234548834324,Roak,anime,8,i do too
559101236390133771,Non,anime,12,Chinami iirc
559101279327223811,Ahenshihael,anime,109,like my biggest problem with  bunnygirl is that it literally was discount-gatari without the charm or the wit
559101297190502431,Roak,anime,63,i hate everyone in sakurasou though <:HAhaa:365617922078539806>
559101728272810029,Ahenshihael,anime,106,let's just put it this way - the only reason I remember just because _existed_ is because it was mentioned

559102037024047104,Ahenshihael,anime,123,Either way_ this shot has better composition than and aesthetic than entirety of bunny girl <:GWumuSmug:399090735607185418>
559102057710092328,araneaesGrasp,anime,74,To be honest_ I liked it more than Bunny Girl_ but that's not saying much.

560634423893032970,Mercrist,recommendations,47,i saw a trailer for it and it seems really edgy
560634435582689291,Rand,general,32,huh? why did you type asterisks?
560634474384064515,Mercrist,recommendations,79,while i like edgy shows a lot i dont like it when they go into cringe territory
560634527282888725,bar,general,32,<:GWtloLaugh:399972379926724610>
560634536178876416,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),recommendations,23,eh_ it's not super edgy
560634577828184064,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),recommendations,39,there's edge_ but you wont cut yourself
560634661630509066,Mercrist,recommendations,7,ah nice

560634675228442652,Lto,casual,38,i've been eating way too much 🍕 lately
560634679171219456,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),recommendations,72,it's worth watching if you like action shows with a slightly darker tone
560634731901878272,NuttyNutt,anime,76,Zankyou no terror or zetsuan tempest? If it's terror_ it's the same director
560634732333891620,Mercrist,recommendations,53,is it a seinen or does it play out more like a shonen
560634764277841940,Mercrist,recommendations,35,it kinda seems like tokyo ghoul too
560634821840207887,Mob,general,3,huh
560634833211097114,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),recommendations,37,honestly it's somewhere in the middle
560634853540888607,Lto,casual,113,and since im in a city with not that much offering when it comes to pizza restaurantsNLI end up going to pizza hut
560634989331611659,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),recommendations,53,i'd say give it a few episodes to decide for yourself

560636059021606932,Sacchi,anime,124,Is the shield hero ln / wn worth reading? Cause I've read the manga and the story gets really generic after a certain point.
560636092576038946,Roak,anime,27,its probably the same garbo

560636813539016715,NuttyNutt,anime,221,The Wn answers questions the world sets up_ like ||what are the waves and why did Glass show up.|| LN is edited with better characters. WN itself is pretty generic and gets weird as he realizes he needs to end it somehow.
560637397088337946,NuttyNutt,anime,90,The WN isn't really worth it at least_ can't say on the LN or how the manga will play out.
