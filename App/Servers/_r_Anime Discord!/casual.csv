558468679164231681,Legend,88,& I didn't smoke cigarettes so the nicotine combined with the salvia fucked me up so bad

558797410797748225,PokeM,152,If you guys want to know_ I think I snagged was able to get a preorder of a game called Fire Emblem: Three Houses Deluxe Edition on the Nintendo Switch.
558797538736603148,PokeM,63,By most accounts_ all preorders should have been done days ago.
558798958483341314,PokeM,93,Assuming it wasn't an oversale_ I should be able to get it when it comes out so I am excited.
558802701303939073,Nomeru,35,why would preorders for a game end?
558802732706693120,Nomeru,36,aside from because the game came out
558806800405757972,PokeM,55,It's Fire Emblem. The series is infamous for preorders.
558807116354289684,PokeM,71,Nintendo doesn't manufacture enough for supply for the deluxe editions.
558807356390244413,PokeM,177,Which of course means limited supply and those preorders get sold out quickly. Most of the time its scalpers buying them in bulk and charging up towards 300% off original price.

559005178381074432,speedfreek16,42,i don't particularly think its a "new age"
559005355326046221,speedfreek16,96,FWIW the current event thing is just a big thing like E3 but for anime as far as i undesrtand it
559005377828618249,Roak,3,yes
559005556204109844,PokeM,103,I'm just exaggerating. This show happens to be my top ten so I was crying in joy when it got announced.
559005905824251904,speedfreek16,81,i feel you on that. I'd be the same if  my top favourite shows got an annoucement
559006770761302018,Roak,64,is oh my goddess a full adaptation <:ehehehe:284826327398481921>

559006997802909697,Roak,20,lodoss war tv (2020)

559007020611797021,Roak,4,damn
559007148760367114,speedfreek16,62,although last A!MG related manga adaptation of an arc was 2008
559007207019118643,speedfreek16,15,so like 6 years
559007259699576880,speedfreek16,45,had anime only OVA tie ins for the manga vols
559007263356878868,Roak,29,the other thing was original?
559007268268539926,speedfreek16,10,after that
559007285850931200,Roak,6,oh lol
559007318956834866,Roak,34,have you read it at the very least
559007366956449793,speedfreek16,33,ive read up until chapter 200-ish
559007381686583316,Roak,2,ah
559007472627613697,speedfreek16,47,ive literally read far beyond what was animated
559007598247018536,speedfreek16,40,there is some great content in the manga
559007798080307211,speedfreek16,111,they had the same director for all of the main entries of the anime_ he just seemed to like to do his own thing
559008035935354910,speedfreek16,85,he hasnt directed any other anime as far as i know_ just been staff in diff positions
559008195432022017,Roak,7,wow lol
559008342215884801,Roak,27,gonna go research this dude
559034321428676619,Ratchet,43,there are 3 other people who have done jack
559034399518228498,Ratchet,34,I'm going to do their shit tonight
559034407705640964,Ratchet,7,I can't
559034431344476160,Ratchet,45,I want to fuck them over and not do any of it
559034461761568768,Ratchet,50,but I'm not going to let my grade suffer with them
559034512592470016,Ratchet,25,it's a group presentation
559034548009304066,Ratchet,55,so if they don't do jack it should do when they present
559034870848815124,Ratchet,77,my group member was laughing about how these guys are technically HS students
559034890000269316,Ratchet,34,and they're complaining about this
559034948867325952,Ratchet,29,it's just fucking infuriating
559074806566354945,Ahao,85,~~But sometimes I'm the guy who doesn't do jack shit unless asked so don't lynch me~~

560600186854965257,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),85,finding the motivation is hard_ but the key is to not excuse yourself from challenges
560600267670814733,Mob,2,ok
560600365834305536,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),162,you know you might be disadvantaged compared to other people your age_ whether its because of financial hardship or whatever else_ so you have to make up for that
560600407743922207,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),56,you have to make up for it by trying harder than they do
560600456791982085,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),24,there's no time to slack
560600494566014996,Mob,38,yeah_ thats something I've done before
560600532553564317,Mob,20,so I can do it again
560600704998178853,Mob,118,i think i should get a degree in something that I can use_ so that way I'll have money to do the things I really enjoy
560600712032026651,Mob,5,maybe
560600784753131550,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),32,it's good to think pragmatically
560600884082507807,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),66,comp sci for programming if that's your goal is an excellent field
560601089574174760,Mob,8,for sure
560601134839103509,Mob,37,although programming would be intense
560601180837904434,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),24,you cant be afraid of it
560601228820742154,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),34,fear and anxiety must be conquered
560601292142280704,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),31,you aint got time for that shit
560601358856880148,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),53,it's anime as fuck_ but if there's something you want
560601417694314497,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),58,you gotta go and take it by your own blood sweat and tears
560602012429975552,Mob,22,thats why I love anime

560608110637482014,ithrewitawayforanime (ergo),108,hate is a strong emotion and hating something that people take as frivolously as birthstones is questionable

560954803207798818,ImperialSympathizer,30,does the interface bother you?
560954918027132928,ImperialSympathizer,105,I'm curious because I haven't checked out firefox in a while and idk if it's considered better these days
560954999480516640,jinx,38,I use firefox and I'm pleased with it.
560955207245234196,jinx,109,I find it somewhat faster than chrome_ but I haven't compared it to chrome since before the aesthetic upgrade
560955453929160727,Lto,50,i find firefox the best when it comes to bookmarks
560964949833416707,iplaythebass,516,Had a very absurd lecture_ the teacher was supposed to talk to us about our next assignment but instead started talking about globalization_ positive atittude_ about how he used to be a student just like us (SHOCKER)_ that we are almost professionals_ the NZ shooting_ being EFFICIENT_ working harder_ and since we have exactly one woman in the classroom also sidetracked to talk about gender equality and the femicides that are reaching the news lately. .. I didn't learn a thing about piezoelectric crystals today.
