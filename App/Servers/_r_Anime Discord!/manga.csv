558436857537626119,scalizo,65,can't say i'm a fan at all of this most recent kaguya development
558436939762630668,scalizo,91,i hate it and it just feels like a massively unnecessary stepback for god knows what reason
558442498385772564,REAMS,27,I think it'd last 1 chapter
558442813293985792,REAMS,37,cool comparison_ Kaguya manga spoiler
558445024442843136,Bacon-chan,277,I've just picked up the Domestic Girlfriend Manga_ and it's interesting. I swear that if someone inserted a few doujin pages here and there and posted it on a hentai website_ it wouldn't look out of place. Like the suppository scene literally has pixelated hoo-hah on the page.
