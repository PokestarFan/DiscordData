558757345178419221,KingToxic12[Bedrock],3,Mhm
558762240942276612,vesko,66,last time i left at here_ now it's time to continue terraforming 😄
558762320805888001,Nanogamer7,35,hwo much time did that take so far?
558765473291042816,vesko,11,13-14 hours
558765534531813377,Nanogamer7,21,Wait_ how? Worldedit?
558765601573699599,Nanogamer7,32,If that's built by hand_ respect
558765602177810462,vesko,2,yh
558765628425764894,Nanogamer7,24,Otherwise_ still respect
558765679239757831,vesko,61,no one in their right mind will place 5million blocks by hand
558765711061680130,Nanogamer7,2,xD
558765716413743130,vesko,46,and spend months on something that takes hours
558765752795136001,vesko,25,for the same final result
558765794083864583,Nanogamer7,13,seems logical
558765945401901056,Nanogamer7,99,do you use a spherical brush and smooth it out afterwards or do you have some more advanced method?
558766018592505858,vesko,41,sand sphreres and smoothing only_ for now
558766041795395585,vesko,35,it's just the base of the ladnscape
558766110908874763,Nanogamer7,2,ok
558766157700661294,Nanogamer7,27,good luck decorating it 😉 😛
558766187832672260,vesko,26,that will be the easy part
558766242765209631,Nanogamer7,7,will it
558766252185747457,vesko,59,hard part is dealing with that "not-so-good" smooth brush 😄
558766267448950826,Soygamer,4,hola

558769953835057155,Nanogamer7,24,how long did *that* take
558770025394339841,vesko,9,30+ hours
558770100946075648,vesko,19,it's an 840x720 map
558770147645718533,Nanogamer7,49,only?! I wouldn't be able to do that in such time
558770175248171008,Nanogamer7,7,respect
558770224665591809,vesko,36,i got more stuff_ it's not just this
558770241640071198,vesko,21,damn mc crashed again
558770366349312001,Nanogamer7,48,wow you are really doing big things with we then
558770372569464842,vesko,85,you can kinda see on the background of my discord pfp that there's some other stuff 😄
558770450218352652,vesko,45,if you want i can post exactly the ones there
558770556368060436,Nanogamer7,31,Yeah sure_ I'd love to see them
558770958723317772,vesko,0,
558771027253919772,Nanogamer7,63,you should definitely post some of them on reddit (r/minecraft)
558771059269304353,Nanogamer7,27,people there will love them
558771220603207680,vesko,0,
558771262063902720,vesko,69,that's it_ the rest of my stuff doesn't have screenshots with shaders
558771543597907978,Nanogamer7,16,there's more O_O
558771685025644568,vesko,52,yea but the rest is just old_ not that good projects
558771873215807528,Nanogamer7,83,probably still better than many of my attempts at terraforming/large scale building
558772035946283010,PopperCatman,35,this was what aviator  made i think
558772037364219904,MEE6,62,Hey <@!557711112750104576>_ you just advanced to **level 6** !
558772077642121226,vesko,124,the ones on the screenshots vary from 400x400 to 840x720_ the one with the black/red tower that i do atm is 800x800_ for now
558772192826097674,Nanogamer7,7,respect
558772366914748419,Nanogamer7,97,<@557711112750104576> look like a nice little project suitable for survival mode aswell 😉 like it
558772420098392065,PopperCatman,4,yeah
558772445495033856,PopperCatman,23,i didint make it though
558772470832955402,PopperCatman,26,someone told me to post it
558772488746565635,PopperCatman,17,but i like it too
558772515455893527,vesko,74,ok now i can't even start the game_ it just crashes as i enter the world..
558772554668441622,Nanogamer7,1,😦
558772656963452929,vesko,99,if i don't manage to make it work i will lose the entire tower with everything i had made around it
558772726727311370,vesko,63,the other 13 builds that are in that world tho.. i have backups
558772728962875422,Nanogamer7,29,Haven't you made any backups?
558772751092023309,Nanogamer7,3,nvm
558772782490583040,vesko,41,i do_ but it's before i started the tower
558772826253950978,vesko,45,so i won't lose the rest of the maps at least
558772922966212630,vesko,33,it loads 2-3 chunks and crashes..
558772952695439380,vesko,33,nvm it crashed as i press "enter"
558773042285641740,Nanogamer7,109,you could ask in <#302987265229979649>_ maybe someone there is more familiar with (more or less) broken saves
558773090222604309,Nanogamer7,34,What do youz have neter bound  to?
558773185064206376,vesko,64,double click with mouse_ to enter the world_ that's what i meant
558773192827863041,Destroyer of Robloxia,2,No
558773272326569993,vesko,68,the issue is that i copied then pasted a selection of 6.7 mil blocks

558809736720678922,vesko,213,<@!402442353886887956> i moved 1/4 of the nether tower and the small tower in the end void and deleted them from their crater so i can now terraform without worrying. Also i spent few hours fixing corrupted chunks
558809740763725824,vesko,3,yes
558809829653610519,VTX-P4ND4,19,Doesnt look like it
558809856342097923,vesko,81,i expanded the smooth brush size to radius 850_ watch me terraform the f outta it
558809954388279296,vesko,78,also i increased the //undo history to 1000_ cuz 15 was never enough for me xD

559018610421399564,Airbear,96,I like them simple but not too simple. Usually a small/medium house with a good amount of detail
559018611457392650,MEE6,63,Hey <@!364247883463131136>_ you just advanced to **level 13** !
559021115079524401,Airbear,86,All the grinding needed in survival to do stuff like that is really discouraging to me
559021197380288524,vesko,105,fun thing_ its several times smaller than the stuff i normally do. it just looks epic so i used it now xd
559021207933026314,Nanogamer7,84,No one said you can't do that in survival <@189346627574562816> it's just reall hard
559021252220682240,Airbear,83,Sure_ it's more rewarding_ but I don't like having to do all the tedious collecting
559021324106858506,AntySocial,32,I'd rather do it in creative tbh
559021378834006066,AntySocial,55,the extra work I'd need to put in isn't worth it for me
559021379647963167,vesko,73,sure brb imma collect 170.000 items. thats how much the tower consists of
559021483570233344,Slooshi1,164,I do not know_ this question is to give me an idea what I want to build if something big and laborious to build or something simple and functional for my base .....
559021541573001240,AntySocial,3,big
559021558920642570,AntySocial,14,and functional
559021668618469404,Airbear,210,The furthest survival I think I've made it in recent times would be a custom Skyblock map me and a friend made. We wrote down 50 unique achievements in a book and saved it_ which really helped keep the pace up.
559021766740017166,AntySocial,29,That sounded like fun Airbear
559021962521870336,Airbear,68,It was_ although it died off eventually ~~just like our friendship~~
559022006750806026,AntySocial,3,oof
559022026946510848,AntySocial,11,FeelsBadMan
559022320644259880,Airbear,84,At first it did_ but generally I'm glad I ditched him and moved on to better friends
559022405302091801,AntySocial,30,As long as you're both happy 😃
559022506514710528,Airbear,1,👀
559022630569639936,Airbear,63,It was a complicated relationship. Not sure where he stands now
559022726279331840,AntySocial,1,🤔
559022763386601472,AntySocial,32,as long as ur not suffering then
559022831653093426,Airbear,107,Occasionally I miss it or feel bad for him_ but honestly there's been so much less drama without him around
559022860069371910,vesko,12,~~builds~~ 😅
559022920739848196,AntySocial,57,I posted a build a while ago and no one commented on it 😦

559052633545900042,DauntingZebra47,53,Ik but I would just copy them which I dont want to do
559052637153001502,riderkotv,21,im building big house
559052657751359520,riderkotv,20,its hard to build it
559052695151837184,riderkotv,31,if i get level 5 i will post it
559052843970068493,Onyx,95,Well the trick is to use some of their techniques and philosophies on your own original builds.
559053040305307681,Onyx,113,Like this is an interesting roof idea_ you can use it on anything that's supposed to be remotely like that style.
559053193427025948,DauntingZebra47,2,Ok
559053555370164257,Onyx,111,Or here's another style of buildings I haven't seen a bunch of people do. I don't even know what you'd call it.
559053709246726155,DauntingZebra47,19,It's kinda colonial
559053805962919952,Onyx,61,My friend said it looked vaguely French but I don't know lol.
559053858609954816,vesko,100,i will try to build guysNLhope that it won't start crashing again and corrupting my chunks 😄 :killme:
559053988910333952,DauntingZebra47,73,It looks like those old colonial houses with marble and other white stone
559054196880703488,Onyx,98,But yeah basically just figure out a style for each build so it doesn't look like random junk lol.
559054228178599958,DauntingZebra47,2,Ok
559055068473851944,Onyx,84,And for terraforming_ I really like GoodTimesWithScar. He does awesome insane stuff.

559057268986085387,Airunt,28,The second floor looks weird
559057306889748503,Airunt,56,I'm trying to figure out what to do with that flat walll
559057327391506432,Airunt,29,But I can't think of anything
559057381191974923,Airunt,46,The balcony helped a little_ but not that much
559057619067731977,Airunt,55,And I need to move the window a little bit to the right
559057644095012864,Tommy "TheLumpyLlama",45,Maybe change the material of the roof itself.
559057711229042696,Tommy "TheLumpyLlama",34,Got too much stone brick going on.
559057759920717825,Tommy "TheLumpyLlama",25,It’s a good shape though!
559057767311343638,Airunt,31,Well I'm planning on doing that
559057791218745364,Airunt,33,But the wall for the second floor
559057807597371407,PBJellytime9,8,its good

559058007107960835,Airunt,52,Probably gonna replace it with potatoes or something

559058040175984680,PBJellytime9,13,potato blocks
559058046048010250,Tommy "TheLumpyLlama",97,It is too flat. You can use other materials such as stairs_ trapdoors_ fences_ etc. to add depth.
559058100737277993,Tommy "TheLumpyLlama",49,I would send a photo but I’m only like level 2 🙃😶
559058181888671765,vesko,31,it needs a 3D pattern basically

559078134729932801,Airunt,53,if spruce was a little bit darker it'd be my favorite
559078140803285012,Onyx,125,The only kind of wood I don't really like is acacia. Too orange. But yet I love acacia trees because they're shaped weird. :P
559078156850561054,aimbait,4,same
559078255643197481,aimbait,37,but anyone else hate the new textures

559078621675913230,Airunt,67,my only problem with lanterns is they don't provide that much light
559078638209859584,Airunt,29,and you can't place that many
559078660876009516,Airunt,32,Otherwise it looks hella crwoded
559078665800122368,Onyx,34,What does glowstone look like now?

559078759505068034,Airbear,45,This was my first impressions of the textures
559078838445932572,aimbait,33,a lot of the textures look blurry

559096784459137024,Cpt_Broombeard,79,<@416425695632293888>  place light source below_ they will then be normal color

559099338882547715,Cpt_Broombeard,84,I mean it looks great_ but yeah. Discover it in Minecraft itself is just super cool.

560948181823782933,Mickenzy,95,you could make a dining table with dining chairs... I like to use doors as chair backs for that
560948639237668879,vesko,90,it can_ i tried it_ but the issue was that my rooms are 3 blocks high_ and the doors are 2

560949484427935755,Chopwood,107,I normally blow up the inside of a mountain and make a bat cave-esque thing and use elytra to fly around...

560949728523714561,JimmyBlether,57,Something just seems off about the bedrock edition to me.
560949839945400360,Onyx,139,If I tried to build in survival I'd just lose patience. I need too many blocks and too many rare types and that'd just limit my creativity.
560949881431130126,Ashtonpl1,58,<@519658375391346698> well that's all for this build so...

560950117759451158,Ashtonpl1,27,I'm following these plans..

560950386437914645,Onyx,98,Imagine the pain of building this in survival. I'd have died so many times from falling damage. :P
560950388480540682,Mickenzy,83,I think what it is_ is that building in survival gives it all more longevity for me
560950417320837140,vesko,33,it's only 240x240 with 230 height
560950423939186715,vesko,8,not much
560950457854459905,Mickenzy,42,but I also have never made any mega builds
560950497377517589,JimmyBlether,34,I never got big stuff done on xbox
560950511432499208,JimmyBlether,9,Too slow.
560950550963683329,Tundra Dredka,54,Wow. I have seen some builds that look real. Nice job.
560950588150644776,Ashtonpl1,102,<@216636780995280896> I just eyeballed it. I'm not going through the pain of getting it the exact size
560950662259539979,Onyx,117,But then I watch hermitcraft and they build insane stuff IN SURVIVAL and I don't know how they have the patience lol.
560950723320217611,JimmyBlether,4,Whoa
560950736528080926,Mickenzy,29,yeah.. that dragon is amazing
560950754316386306,Mickenzy,38,I could never make something like that
560950768492871700,Mickenzy,24,in creative or otherwise
560950778597212160,JimmyBlether,11,Me neither.
560950806979936266,vesko,14,he's a big boi
560951143996325912,Mickenzy,75,that's another part of why I like playing in survival... there's more to do
560951209729589315,Mickenzy,70,I mean.. you can the same stuff in creative_ but what for_ y'know? lol
560951214632730634,Tundra Dredka,48,Trees. Why cant we change them to fancy anymore?
560954171558330398,JimmyBlether,6,Lolwut
560954178759950356,Mickenzy,36,yeaaaah that looks pretty ridiculous
560954634651435029,Mickenzy,105,how do you guys go about making roads with multiple different blocks_ and make them look randomly placed?
560954665060139019,Mickenzy,52,so that the road doesn't end up with a pattern in it
560954866848104449,Onyx,88,I just never place more than 5 of the same block together lol. I pretend it's Tetris. :P
560954889090629633,Mickenzy,3,lol
560954960926212157,Mickenzy,78,I suppose I could use multisided dice_ and assign a number to each block... XD
560955022700052490,Mickenzy,30,that would take forever though
560955027670302723,Mickenzy,3,lol
