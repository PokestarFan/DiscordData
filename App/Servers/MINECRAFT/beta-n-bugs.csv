558762105822511149,EchoTetris,109,I was chopping a dark oak tree_ i went in 3rd person_ looked down_ and tried to spin around and noticed this.
558762894427291668,EchoTetris,93,I also realized you don't have to be under a tree and that you can do it in 3rd person front.
558763863412047884,EchoTetris,120,its basically that looking completely up or down while in third person causes the camera to not completely focus on you.
558766981638258709,DuDe~,59,Anyone mentioned the frame rate freezes for Switch bedrock?
558767056384819416,Zeppel1nz,252,Is anyone else having severe problems with lag on Nintendo Switch Bedrock? I'm constantly getting lag spikes in singleplayer_ multiplayer_ and servers. In multiple and servers I can't play more than 5 minutes without disconnecting and I  lag constantly
558767143588462602,Zeppel1nz,16,Bruh that timing
558767316125483038,DuDe~,100,It's not as much lag for me as it is just complete frame halts for like 3 seconds every minute or so
558767663669575721,Zeppel1nz,122,That's what's happening to me too. I  can hear the music keep jittering and repeating the same notes like it's gonna crash
558767891709689867,Zeppel1nz,87,Sometimes when  I try to leave the game Minecraft freezes and it takes a while to close
