558433938234671105,MEE6,62,Hey <@!245669771071324183>_ you just advanced to **level 6** !
558435569999413251,Sprinkles,23,Will this be for 1.13+?
558435599250489351,Fendoran,17,newest update yes
558435713385889804,Sprinkles,515,Let me check if I got an objective name right_ but otherwise here's my response:NLNLI could directly convert these commands into their 1.13+ form.NL```/scoreboard players add @p[scores={vex=1..}] money 2NL/scoreboard players remove @p[scores={vex=1..}] vex 1```NL```/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=10000..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:"minecraft:villager"}}NL/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=10000..}] money 10000```NL```/scoreboard objectives add creeper killed:creeper creeper```
558435796395360256,Fendoran,23,would u do that for me?
558438596533813248,Fendoran,7,oh wait
558438615819223051,Fendoran,25,this is the updated form?
558438631715504153,Sprinkles,7,Yessir!
558438847374163988,Fendoran,80,so why'd they change all this_ i mean_ what was the problem with the old system?
558439122482757642,Sprinkles,226,The old system was inefficient_ outdated_ and crude with lots of useless commands. This updated system has a new parser_ completely rewritten commands and storage_ and merged useless commands into others so they became useful.
558439287213785098,Fendoran,132,so you recognise ?NL```/scoreboard players add @p[scores={vex=1..}] money 2NL/scoreboard players remove @p[scores={vex=1..}] vex 1NL```
558439317530214429,Fendoran,28,ever used it before_ i mean?
558439451752267806,Sprinkles,84,I have_ yeah. Scores use ranges instead of "at least <number>" or "at most <number>"
558439501634994177,Sprinkles,234,If I wanted to store the number of items I have in my hand to a score_ I'd runNL`/execute as @p store result score @s itemCount run data get entity @s SelectedItem`NLWe can do so much more thanks to the changes in the commands from 1.13
558439522292203521,Fendoran,22,ok so i got a question
558439553443299329,Fendoran,23,idk if you had the same
558439590474678272,Fendoran,59,but i used to have 2 command blocks side by side each other
558439610762657812,Fendoran,31,each with the different command
558439644014968833,Fendoran,50,with redstone and the other thing i can't remember
558439666337054721,Fendoran,32,constantly blinking to be active
558439782431064074,Fendoran,35,any more efficient way of doing it?
558439825707892737,OMSIN,53,<@482247702311337985> Are there anyone andwered you ?
558439905429159946,Sprinkles,47,I assume you mean running a command constantly?
558440035133816852,Fendoran,67,it kinda has to if they want instant money from killing a creature?
558440298146037766,Sprinkles,196,Redstone and commands don't mix well these days_ but some people use them still. Repeating command blocks run their commands twenty times per second_ if you need commands to be running that often.
558440347454406676,OMSIN,63,<@482247702311337985> I guess you are using Linux_ am I right ?
558440450294284292,Fendoran,73,so how does that even work_ so 2 command blocks on top of eachother right
558440625700077577,Fendoran,172,This one at the bottom with Repeating and Always ActiveNL```/scoreboard players add @p[scores={vex=1..}] money 2```NLNL```/scoreboard players remove @p[scores={vex=1..}] vex 1
558441131340333086,Sprinkles,138,You can use a repeating command block for the first_ and point that into an always active chain command block. They will execute together.
558441251305816085,Fendoran,73,do they have to be side by side or can they also be on top of each other?
558441691128791041,Fendoran,69,btw_ NL```/scoreboard objectives add creeper killed:creeper creeper```
558441711743795243,Fendoran,31,seem to not be working properly
558441862634012682,Fendoran,25,the problem is at the end
558441890534391839,Fendoran,23,with the "display name"
558441939381256193,OMSIN,372,<@482247702311337985> Please check:NLNLHave u restart the server_ if not pls try restart it.NLNLAre you hosting multiple server ?

If these cannot help_ try restart your computer and try again.
558441961359540249,Sprinkles,110,Ah_ that's a JSON component. For simplicity's sake_ you can shorten that to `"creeper`" with quotes around it.
558442097418436609,Fendoran,18,ahh i need "" then
558442110022451245,Fendoran,3,but
558442120705212467,Sprinkles,95,And no_ command blocks can be in essentially any rotation as long as they point into each other
558442392567545859,Fendoran,180,Ok so wich of these oes into wich? first one purple and second one green?NL/scoreboard players add @p[scores={vex=1..}] money 2NL/scoreboard players remove @p[scores={vex=1..}] vex 1
558442466517319702,Sprinkles,59,Yep. if you did it the other way around_ it might not work.
558442561782677504,Fendoran,30,and set both to always active?
558442590601609229,Sprinkles,4,Yes.
558442743475470347,OMSIN,88,The green one need to be always active if you want it to always run with the purple one.
558442858030432257,OMSIN,65,The purple one you can place redstone to activate it when u need.
558442941920706570,OMSIN,69,It's okay to set it to always active if you decided to always run it.
558442950388875284,Fendoran,37,but it can also be always active yes?
558442974976016384,Sprinkles,12,It can_ yes.
558443028801519640,Fendoran,28,ok another dumb question inc
558443075832119306,Fendoran,50,how do i make them line in so perfectly as you did
558443156950220810,Sprinkles,39,They're rotational_ similar to pistons.
558443316237303818,OMSIN,38,The arrow points to u when u place it.
558443381424914453,Fendoran,20,ok gonna test it now
558443582604836864,Fendoran,7,oh shit
558443621335040002,Fendoran,28,forgot how to add money also
558443722170302485,Fendoran,31,the add scoreboard money money?
558444115394560001,Sprinkles,4,Huh?
558444292671012864,Fendoran,55,you know the side objective that displays your currency
558444400838049817,Sprinkles,49,It's not working now? What were you using before?
558444434996330506,Fendoran,3,uhm
558444445633216568,Fendoran,12,let me check
558444659496714252,Fendoran,114,Something like this?NL```/scoreboard objectives add money DollarNL/scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar money```
558444864002588682,Sprinkles,186,`Dollar`'s not a valid objective. If you're looking for an objective that doesn't change until you tell it to_ you would use `dummy`.NL```/scoreboard objectives add money dummy "Dollar"``
558445012866564117,Fendoran,38,and the setdisplay should be the same?
558445065337307137,Sprinkles,30,Yeah. That part hasn't changed
558445275568406531,Fendoran,30,idk if've done something wrong
558445290437476352,Fendoran,22,but not working for me
558445339447787552,Fendoran,0,
558445363904774144,Fendoran,0,
558445390240677888,Fendoran,0,
558445997236420629,Sprinkles,117,Is `zombie` a valid objective? If so_ make sure your score's increasing. Otherwise I'm not sure why it's not working.
558446122436263937,Fendoran,10,i added it
558446379672928258,Fendoran,7,ahh yeh
558446392163434517,Fendoran,16,it's working now
558446716953821207,Sprinkles,13,Good to hear!
558447070814404610,LitNotFig,3,hey

558447752615428106,Sprinkles,79,I'd say the actual name of the file_ but the moderation bot tends to delete it.
558447813260869662,Fendoran,9,sprunkles
558447844734795776,LitNotFig,12,its not here
558447865698058240,Fendoran,57,you know any good sites to generate codes signs for shop?
558447893724528651,LitNotFig,24,can I send someone a pic
558447915178393639,Fendoran,69,i used to use https://minecraftcommand.science/command-sign-generator
558447916201803800,LitNotFig,13,of the config
558447933608165399,Fendoran,18,but it's for 1.8..
558447962762641413,Sprinkles,39,It's in the server(dot)properties file.
558448095550242837,Sprinkles,70,Until I memorized JSON_ I used this site: <https://minecraftjson.com/>
558448254350655499,LitNotFig,2,oh
558448255478792193,MEE6,62,Hey <@!427497508340760586>_ you just advanced to **level 1** !
558448271270608896,LitNotFig,14,he said config
558448367714435072,LitNotFig,40,also how do i make it so mobs dont spawn
558448432352591891,Fendoran,94,does this site allow me to just paste in a code_ or do i have to actualy type in shiet myself?
558448546374877199,LitNotFig,37,wait_ I can change the resourse pack?
558448674645213184,Sprinkles,91,You click the Add Text button_ then insert some text at the top_ then click Add Text again.
558448808577466411,Sprinkles,47,Although... it seems this isn't updated either.
558448930493562910,Sprinkles,246,lol this was the `/give` command it gave me:NL```/give @p sign 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"[\"\"_{\"text\":\"asd\"}]"_id:"Sign"}}```NLWhen it should look like this:NL```/give @p sign{BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"[\"\"_{\"text\":\"asd\"}]"_id:"Sign"}} 1```
558449115596324891,Sprinkles,97,It's especially wrong in 1.14_ as oak/spruce/etc. types of signs exist. So it's a little outdated
558449137868079105,Fendoran,209,what if i wanted a sign for ```/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:"minecraft:villager"}}NL/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] money 5```
558449162929307654,LitNotFig,46,how do you put that weird box around the text?
558449247679414282,Fendoran,48,with 3x ` at the beginning and the end of a text
558449307166965762,Sprinkles,128,You use backticks. It's good for ignoring discord's formatting.NL\`small block\`: `example`NL\`\`\`code block\`\`\`:NL```example```
558449430387228682,Sprinkles,69,It also supports syntax highlighting.NL```jsonNL{NL    "example": 1NL}```
558449525099069450,Sprinkles,37,A sign that... does those things? hmm
558449596070756352,LitNotFig,9,thank you
558449613204488212,Fendoran,64,mhm_ is what i used to have_ i also had nice coloring etc etc...
558449619869106187,LitNotFig,24,now all my commands work
558449659505278978,LitNotFig,51,can i send one of you all the command blocks i used
558449976129355776,Sprinkles,143,The issue with having commands like that on a sign is players will need operator permissions to run certain commands like `/give` or `/gamemode
558450032387555328,Sprinkles,21,You could_ sure [Lit]
558450042764001280,Fendoran,28,didn't use to when i had it?
558450124682952705,Fendoran,33,i think i had like tellraw though
558450309395906560,Sprinkles,204,If you want players to be able to interact with things on signs with click events like that_ you could set up a trigger objective with the `/trigger` command instead. That's what that command was made for
558450500165566526,Fendoran,37,I'm not experienced with these things
558450521623625729,Fendoran,25,so i wouldn't know how to
558450897504567296,LitNotFig,51,can someone come on my server and test this with me
558451225188892674,Sprinkles,618,Trigger objectives are scoreboards that anyone can modify for themselves. They need to be activated first to change them_ and deactivate when modified.NLYou could have a sign with a click event to run a `/trigger` command that changes a trigger scoreboard_ and check if a player's score changes.NLNLLet's pretend we have a trigger objective called "test". In the sign you got your click event that has this: `/trigger test`NLThe command succeeds_ then you check for the score change in another command block: `execute as @a if score @s test matches 1.. run <command>`NLIt's rather hard to explain_ but that's the basic idea
558451533935673355,Fendoran,21,shoouldn't be needed?
558451582543593473,Fendoran,58,all my signs on my old server noone had problems accesing?
558451702160949248,Sprinkles,93,They must have had some kind of permission to use them. Or there was some mod magic happening
558451749577293844,Sprinkles,53,Non-operator players shouldn't have access to `/give`
558452173885669377,Fendoran,22,well they could anyway
558452430551908362,Fendoran,31,but anyways_ first things first
558452468430929921,LitNotFig,43,can someone come and test this for with me/
558452545509654528,Fendoran,544,noone has updated their websites to make something like ```/give @p sign 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"color\":\"blue\"}"_Text2:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:\\"minecraft:villager\\"}}\"}}"_Text3:"{\"text\":\"$ 5_- \"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] money 5\"}}"}_display:{Name:"Custom Sign"}}```

558452730725793812,Fendoran,29,this is to give "me" the sign
558452736383909928,Fendoran,8,not them
558452786220761098,Fendoran,81,i use a command block to give me the sign and then i hang it op for people to use
558453010850643998,OMSIN,58,I think it the same like get people to run /give ghast egg
558453064462237726,OMSIN,40,And they have no permission to use /give
558453114579976203,Fendoran,18,they don't have to
558453145693323274,Fendoran,40,the /give is to give me the sign anyways
558453225712517123,OMSIN,75,Clicking the sign is the same with shortcut for running command_ isn't it ?
558453299154518016,Fendoran,13,it's the idea
558453497776046120,Sprinkles,540,Most of that is the same_ just changing this:NL```jsonNL/give @p oak_sign{BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"color\":\"blue\"}"_Text2:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:\\\"minecraft:villager\\\"}}\"}}"_Text3:"{\"text\":\"$ 5_- \"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] money 5\"}}"}_display:{Name:"Custom Sign"}}```
558453517862305815,OMSIN,76,So when people click the sign_ it's the same with typing /give .............

558467345623023616,Fendoran,14,finaly got it!
558467378430869514,Fendoran,21,jesus how complicated
558467698305138719,Fendoran,46,so you agree that once i give myself this sign
558467706920370187,Fendoran,14,and put it out
558467735902748672,Fendoran,39,noone needs commands to click on it 😃 ?
558468653029523457,Sprinkles,57,If they have operator permissions_ anyone can use it yeah
558468761645088789,Fendoran,70,so without operator permission noone can use it is what you're saying?
558468805508988939,Sprinkles,53,Basically. You'd need to use a `/trigger` click event
558468836093853716,Fendoran,36,now i mean without the /give command
558468949956755466,Fendoran,66,because the command they're basically using is /scoreboard players
558469142060072960,Sprinkles,62,Non-op'd players don't have access to `/scoreboard` or `/give`
558469517299417099,Fendoran,88,i swear to you i've seen people use it and it works_ but i can't test it untill tomorrow
558469569908310025,Fendoran,61,mind me contacting you if it doesn't for a possible solution?
558469623373103126,Fendoran,29,gonna have to go to sleep now
558469873806737408,Sprinkles,73,I'm not sure if I will be up when you contact me_ but you can if you wish
558470058448388126,Fendoran,61,I will try_ you could always leave a reply whenever you can 😃
558470811556511785,CultivatingWithCameron,45,When you deop yourself on your own server....
558470884881596417,CultivatingWithCameron,36,Then you realized that you messed up
558472278547890186,The Llama Next Door,65,How does this server have a /minecraft invite instead of numbers?
558472463587999762,Sprinkles,98,it's an official partnered server (or the owner is a discord partner) so they get a custom invite.
558472556198494209,Sprinkles,88,The owner of the Terraria server's a discord partner_ and they have a custom invite too.
558472717607632896,The Llama Next Door,43,Does that have to do with the vericication?
558472811572625431,Sprinkles,109,Maybe? I know for sure it has to do with the Discord Partner thing_ but maybe verified servers get those too.
558472835916627978,The Llama Next Door,2,Ok
558472883639418909,The Llama Next Door,26,Do most servers have that?
558472912886300672,Sprinkles,26,A verification symbol? no.
558473036055969792,The Llama Next Door,34,Do most servers have a partnership
558473134777303100,Sprinkles,82,That I'm not sure of. Some discord members are Discord Partners_ not many of them.
558473183334891521,The Llama Next Door,12,Oh ok thanks
558755060214136832,zorenine,220,Ohh okay.  I use to have that mod but then I found something so disappointing. Your not able to do double dmg when duel wielding. like that to me just destroys the whole entire purpose of duel wielding in the first place

558796681982771200,ɮǟʀʀʏϩ⊘ ₁९⍰⍰⍰⍰,145,and when i use my second monitor the preformance goes to 0% and when i move the window back to my built in display and restart_ it just goes back
558796791072686091,ɮǟʀʀʏϩ⊘ ₁९⍰⍰⍰⍰,30,is there anyway i can fix this
558796803617718272,Red_Bones,63,so you have had one connected at one time! thats what im asking

558797044433682442,ɮǟʀʀʏϩ⊘ ₁९⍰⍰⍰⍰,39,like i said it corrupts the preformance
558797127455866890,Red_Bones,20,what gpu do you use?
558797352769683456,ɮǟʀʀʏϩ⊘ ₁९⍰⍰⍰⍰,24,my laptop's built in one

558797570357329932,Red_Bones,26,okay go to settings/system
558797612145180677,Red_Bones,35,first option is going to be display

558797803544117279,ɮǟʀʀʏϩ⊘ ₁९⍰⍰⍰⍰,16,it shows default
558798039414734886,ɮǟʀʀʏϩ⊘ ₁९⍰⍰⍰⍰,18,welp im ||fucked||
558799026124750868,Red_Bones,252,well i would say_ the next time you connect the second monitor _ update drivers for monitor and then make sure you have the default one as your primary #1 monitor_ than disconnect it. updating drivers for that monitor should fix your proformance issue.
558799204504436736,ɮǟʀʀʏϩ⊘ ₁९⍰⍰⍰⍰,49,I have to restart my pc to get normal preformance

Open that with an explorer program like WinRAR or 7Zip_ and navigate further to `assets > minecraft > textures`NL4. Copy that folder.NLNow you'll need to make a resource pack_ and put those textures into it. There's plenty of tutorials online for making resource packs.

558868450064334859,1hn,27,but i might be able to help
558868517496291329,connoredmo,30,were using permisionsX or pex.
558868536823644162,1hn,2,ok
558868545971290172,1hn,18,whats the problem?
558868844425379842,connoredmo,301,basically we are trying to set it up so everyone can break a spawner with a silk pic and get the /warp spawn and /sethome setup. we put in the pex but now only opped people can do anything :/ im trying to add them to a group we made called member but it isnt working /pex group <group> user add (name)
558868922359873545,1hn,2,ok
558868944648273930,1hn,25,so you said 1.13.2 right?
558868956237004810,connoredmo,3,yea
558869014441492502,1hn,68,so do you have the plugin where u can break spawners with silk pics?

558869100999475231,1hn,40,also did u make the member rank default?
558869181655941174,1hn,94,if its not default_ then if a new player joins_ staff will manually have to give them the rank
558869275092320267,1hn,121,also when you're adding permissions_ dont do pex group member add /warp.NLinstead_ do pex group member add essentials.warp
558869321351168021,1hn,40,you need to know the name of the command
558869333875359746,1hn,25,so that pex can recognize
558869374618828800,1hn,64,so for /warp you need to do pex group member add essentials.warp
558869439362367489,connoredmo,84,idk how to make it default im new to this but for the past few weeks ive been trying

559002237859397634,twynics,204,Hey_ does anybody know how I could modify the packets I send so that the second and third hit I land on someone is delayed? So for example: Hit 1: Not delayed Hit 2: Delayed by 30ms Hit 3: Delayed by 70ms
559002304871661584,twynics,90,This would allow for some interesting combos. I'd like to leaern if there's a way to do it
559002450283986944,Greymagic27,83,<@!344770126077231105> You still there? If so move to <#302987265229979649> with me

559028242489540610,foxotic,27,<@517443822578302977> 1.14?
559031158923591731,skztr,179,<@229242820827938817> I know nothing about the protocol_ but I'd be surprised if the hit success of the "hit" (as opposed to the attempt) is part of the packet. What is your goal?

559049951309725707,Notorious RS,362,So I have this issue where I get high fps (80-130) however_ it feels like im constantly in the 40s and 50s. Ive tried increasing the amount of RAM MC uses_ didnt work_ installed mods like optifine_ fastcraft etc_ didnt work_ checked refresh rate_ drivers are up to date_ V sync is off etc. Ive tried most things that Ive found on google_ anyone know how to help?
559050042191642629,Notorious RS,53,I got a Ryzen 7 1700_ GTX 1060 6GB & 16GB RAM 3200Mhz
559050301659807744,Notorious RS,63,This stuttering happens everywhere_ be it a server or solo game
559050611044122654,Johnathon,12,Try vsync on
559050772491403264,Notorious RS,8,did that
559050840594186255,Johnathon,3,Hmm
559051295227510794,Notorious RS,91,its not screen tearing_ it feels like im in the 50s despite my actual fps showing otherwise
559061022229397505,Grubeis,46,How do I change the trades with the villagers?
559062105123455006,Sprinkles,334,You can specify their trades in each one's NBT_ Grubeis. I think that's called `Offers`_ this example *should* summon a villager that trades a stick for a diamond. I'll test it in a sec:NLNL```/summon villager ~ ~ ~ {Offers:{Recipes:[{maxUses:2147000000_buy:{id:"minecraft:stick"_Count:1b}_sell:{id:"minecraft:diamond"_Count:1b"}}]}}```
559062723690889232,Grubeis,46,<@!209861974102638592>  It didn't seem to work
559062873796509711,Sprinkles,127,I'm gonna test it! 😅 I might need to look at their NBT_ I was basing this off of the information from the article on villagers.
559062940452388911,Grubeis,47,<@!209861974102638592>  Thanks for the help btw
559062982705807380,Sprinkles,11,No problem.
559063238290178048,Sprinkles,60,I had an extra quotation mark... `...Count:1b"`*`<--[HERE]`*
559063283492192258,Sprinkles,15,I'm such a dork
559063341667057684,Grubeis,94,<@!209861974102638592>  Is it possible to change the output of light of say a glowstone block?
559063427079864341,Sprinkles,61,I don't think so_ no. Not without modifying the game somehow.
559065326545797120,Yaiton,18,I have a problem..

559065639181090817,Deoxys_0,678,Okay..... Can someone help me out here please? I'm considering going back to my java version of Minecraft due to annoying limitations with other versions_ but if I'm going to do that_ I'm going to mod it like crazy. What are the best mods_ if any_ that are still kept up to date that meet the following things?NL-Multiple dimensions.NL-New mobs.NL-New bosses.NL-Automation.NL-Storage.NL-'Sciencey' type stuff.NL-More biomes.NL-More randomly generated structures.NL-Technical stuff_ like advanced redstone.NLI have some mods in mind_ but I'm worried that they may not be compatible with each other or may cause a "clown vomit" world generation due to too many things being present at once.

559107222412460036,Dogsteeves,0,
559107234966142986,Gapbro,11,use youtube
559109900962234522,Gapbro,151,<@137432458319757312> wait how do I actually use that code_  put it in a command block_ is it supposed to give an item or do I need a comparater output
559110043526627356,tryashtar,41,It just adds that tag to pufferfish items
559110083770843136,Gapbro,46,right I changed around the things I needed too
559110120596963330,Gapbro,28,okay so If I drop a snowball
559110133896970241,Gapbro,19,it will at that tag
559110167401332746,tryashtar,31,If you changed it correctly yes
559110173701177374,Gapbro,37,does that account for throwing aswell
559110198547972106,tryashtar,26,Throwing with right-click?
559110211806429194,Gapbro,3,yes
559110222300446735,tryashtar,2,No
559110245192826890,tryashtar,30,What tag are you doing anyhow?
559110275010134017,Gapbro,26,arrower is what I named it
559110304395689995,Gapbro,36,I want a snowball that throws arrows
559110315065868352,Gapbro,22,but not every snowball
559110392874401832,tryashtar,70,Then can't you just doNL`execute at @e[type=snowball] run summon arrow`
559110437786877965,Gapbro,16,oooooooooooooooh
559110469369987093,Gapbro,63,yeah that sounds right_ sorry Im still used to the new commands
559110480053010453,Gapbro,14,I miss testfor
559110553725960192,tryashtar,36,What did you use it for in the past?
559110583459250194,tryashtar,48,Even in 1.12 there were better ways to do things
559110623552602150,Gapbro,61,well I used it for silly crap like summoning pigs with sticks
559110666359799808,Gapbro,22,or testing for players
559110682990215168,Gapbro,16,and making traps
559110768037986326,tryashtar,84,The problem with testfor is it doesn't tell you who was found_ just that someone was
559110786933588008,tryashtar,42,So you can't target them in later commands
559110856353251330,tryashtar,32,In some cases that's fine though
559110865597628476,Gapbro,64,wait so when I throw something I'm pretty sure it loses that tag
559110899097403392,Gapbro,37,its only a tag when its in the hotbar
559110991468560545,tryashtar,91,Yeah_ the NBT will stay as an item_ but not transfer to the snowball entity to my knowledge
559111026792988676,Gapbro,5,right
559111067335393280,Gapbro,48,and I want my *thrown* snowball to summon arrows
559111088797384717,Gapbro,32,I know I can summon it with like
559111185392336978,Gapbro,42,```/summon snowball ~ ~ ~ {tag=arrower}```

560629358109130782,Snack Machine,53,I always see like 6 diffrent sites with mod downloads
560629366552264725,Kurumi Tokisaki,23,I myself use Curseforge
560629496047337492,Kurumi Tokisaki,19,I pm'd you the link
560637219082076203,Cooslur,20,forge wont load mods
560637286132219934,Cooslur,43,i followed instructions and they wont load.
560637376955940874,Piggles101,83,did you make sure the version of your mods match the version of forge that you got?
560637451463426050,Cooslur,3,yes
560637481960210464,Cooslur,12,forge 1.12.2
560637509206409216,Cooslur,25,wont load optifine 1.12.2
560637585693605888,Cooslur,24,it doesnt show up at all
560637614558937088,Cooslur,7,in game
560637682846400523,Piggles101,33,optifine doesnt need forge to run
560637746067144705,Cooslur,2,ik
560637795161604136,Piggles101,38,you want them to run at the same time?
560637813519941654,Cooslur,3,yes
560637879366451201,Piggles101,63,ah_ I see_ yeah I havent figured that out myself either_ sorry.
560637921804156928,Cooslur,23,and i have 2 other mods
560637951722258442,Cooslur,20,work with 1.12.2 too
560637989139513344,Cooslur,28,and forge wont load them too
560638141455925260,whoms,96,You are doing something wrong then. Are you mods a .jar file and in `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods`?
560638169549242368,Cooslur,3,yes
560638215845838868,Sprinkles,157,Running optifine with forge should be pretty straightforward; you install the forge modloader_ then drop the optifine mod file in the appropriate mods folder
560638307244048384,Cooslur,6,i did.
560638332175122432,Cooslur,0,
560638354606129154,Cooslur,23,these are the only mods
560638587746517002,Sprinkles,138,~~autotip lmao~~NLYeah_ I don't see any reason for why it couldn't be working. Maybe the Optifine site's FAQ has some troubleshooting tips?
560638617937117185,foxotic,295,Hey java peeps_ im pretty new with learning about DATA packs and BEHAVIOR packs -- This guy made a custom mob with a BEHAVIOR Pack; How possible is it to do this in java? The entity does not override an exisiting one. it has its own AI and spawner egg.NLhttps://mcpedl.com/spyro-the-dragon-addon/
560638743325966337,CraftyGamer_,76,Does CustomModelData only work for digits_ or can it work with letters_ too?
560638765954236435,Cooslur,43,autotip was in there when i installed forge
560638771540918272,Sprinkles,110,Behavior pack isn't a data pack. Behavior packs might be able to create unique entities_ but data packs can't.
560638813613850642,Sprinkles,40,<@340933245971464192> It's only integers
560638868647575563,foxotic,65,<@!209861974102638592> possible in 1.14 with CustomModelData ^^ ?
560638973244866591,Cooslur,16,i figured it out
560638988881231872,Sprinkles,91,CustomModelData only remodels items. It can't remodel blocks (to my knowledge) or entities.
560639043084484609,foxotic,4,rats
560639065888653312,{ᏝᏬᏒᏦᏕ},52,i guess the person wants to make a java version mod?
560639086113718292,foxotic,42,So no armor remodels coming to 1.14 either
560639250240897044,foxotic,147,Lorks I was looking into making a vanilla custom mob like this behavior pack_ was wondering if there was something in the API to call for a new one
560639276111495178,Sprinkles,193,In a way_ you could use CustomModelData to remodel an item_ then place that on an armor stand's head that constantly teleports to an existing entity. But I'm sure that's not what you meant haha
560639332587798559,foxotic,33,yeah ive tried that_ bad idea lol
560639349989834753,foxotic,24,too much lag on a server
560639375872884752,FPSKoda4,301,Can i get some redstone help? I can screenshare i tried watching a video on how to make a leaver lock but it  was soo confusing and trying to hit you with all the information at once it's hard for me to keep up or trying to see how i can do it in this situation NLMuch help would be greatly appreciated
560639397800837130,foxotic,44,the armorstand doesnt precise location do it
560639406575190030,Cooslur,48,i figured it all out_ so thank you for your time
560639506772918272,Sprinkles,49,I wasn't much help_ but yeah_ no problem Cooslur.
560639559185072129,Cooslur,21,this is what happened
560639642181959710,Sprinkles,40,Armor stand entities is a bit... finicky
560639727552954378,Cooslur,0,
560639767407099904,foxotic,66,Right so im probably just gonna have to rely on optifine JPM files
560639773048307715,Cooslur,32,i had a different game directory
560639803616657438,foxotic,31,so semi-modded client side mobs
560639850857103371,foxotic,69,Can remodel them with nbt tags but no custom AI like this spyro thing
560639890425905152,Cooslur,58,thats why it didnt load the mods in .minecraft\mods folder
560639977059516417,Cooslur,5,i put
560640046529642497,Cooslur,30,because i looked in the folder
560640046596882432,Sprinkles,65,Ah_ that's a tricky problem. Glad you got it figured out quickly!
560640113860804613,Cooslur,29,a new mods folder was created
560640140863864842,Cooslur,16,when i ran forge
560640214196944906,Cooslur,43,ok so_ i put the mods in the game directory
560640242294456361,Cooslur,19,lets hope it works.
560640264666873859,Cooslur,26,i will tell you if it does
560640281633095691,Sprinkles,1,👌
560640350612357131,Sprinkles,43,*Why does mobile discord's ok_hand suck...*
560640466056511518,Cooslur,3,idk
560640508133769218,Cooslur,34,different for every device i think
560640522528751626,Cooslur,4,also
560640539364425746,Cooslur,9,it works!
560640560789192714,Sprinkles,18,Aye. Good to hear!
560640571492925446,Cooslur,22,shows optifine loading
560640585330065409,Cooslur,7,already
560640614463569957,Cooslur,23,so the rest should work
560641248298532864,FPSKoda4,17,So uh... Nothing?
560641337897123851,Cooslur,14,the rest works
560641356100272132,Cooslur,10,also what?
560641377474576395,BigFatKat,57,<@318113640333049856> working on it gotta run paper first
560641425604083713,whoms,2,Ye
560641466712588304,whoms,63,When you download it_ run the server once per doubleclick on it
560641565182132224,whoms,99,It will create the EULA file_ change `Eula=false` to `Eula=true` and then start it from a start.bat
