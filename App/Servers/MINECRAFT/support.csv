560646159912271872,_RUDENESS_,39,can someone point me in that direction?
560646419849936896,SpiritFire,82,some may be older. but you can google or youtube search for minecraft server setup
560646636624412692,SpiritFire,73,https://postimg *dot* cc/VdY26CjJ for a photo of my issues im having atm.
560646707914735616,BootrFangers,197,here is a wiki page on creating a server_ it should be up to date for 1.12.2 but it does advise some knowledge before starting a server https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Setting_up_a_server
560646905063800843,SpiritFire,52,you have to creatively edit my url to make it work üòõ
560647168382337035,SpiritFire,41,its like  chunks that just refuse to load
560647264700203039,BootrFangers,27,the mobs are still spawning
560647355918057473,SpiritFire,109,yea. and i notice on my wifes computer when shes on that the areas i dont see and what she sees are different
560647432220835853,SpiritFire,22,which is even stranger
560647442866110524,BootrFangers,30,thats a server issue i believe
560647530975854598,SpiritFire,81,nods.. i agree. but i havent been able to find any info on it anywhere ive looked
560647721724149780,SpiritFire,41,if i jump onto the empty area i get stuck
560647754104307732,SpiritFire,23,and it wont let me move
560647830411280414,Optical,47,Seems like there is an invisible block probably
560647864947310592,Optical,33,Try putting a block in that place
560647925777170452,SpiritFire,49,look at that screenie i posted if you can optical

560648792194678785,SpiritFire,86,i made a new world. now this is wierd. its fine when im logged in alone on the server.

560648935924826114,SpiritFire,61,yea i deleted the old world when i updated the snapshot today
560649003859968010,SpiritFire,54,let me log in on my wifes machine and check it out now
560649156343889920,BootrFangers,44,ooo they've updated the website_ looks fancy
560649440499728404,SpiritFire,57,lol!.. i dont know why.. but now its working.... *boggle*
560649524297728002,{·èù·è¨·èí·è¶·èï},29,sometimes tech r very strange
560649532204122113,BootrFangers,41,the snapshot probably messed up something
560649556782481418,_RUDENESS_,2,ok
560649577401679892,_RUDENESS_,9,mb is doe
560649595395506197,_RUDENESS_,15,and i restarted
560649750844669964,SpiritFire,165,on a completely seperate note..  how do you make those darn pillagers go away. lol. this new world we started on.. they are right close by killing us over and over..
560649852242100224,SpiritFire,49,they have a spawn box or a building i can destroy
560649953685405723,BootrFangers,109,I have the same issue_ I had the bad omen effect 24/7 because they keep spawning about every 2 Minecraft days
560650011117879320,SpiritFire,48,i kill them and they just respawn 1 minute later
560650061302726687,SpiritFire,60,they are annoying the crap out of my family trying to play üòÑ
560650079367725056,BootrFangers,42,I think they naturally spawn near villages
560650193758978076,SpiritFire,131,from the snapshot video i saw_ it says they can spawn where a village would spawn.. aka.. its either a village or a pillager spawn.
560650203863056384,{·èù·è¨·èí·è¶·èï},52,wow thats fast respawn_ just build a wall around lol
560650330015137804,SpiritFire,152,the other two people playing are my wife and my mother. its gotten to the point they dont even want to play cuz they are dieing constantly to these guys
560650366576754708,BootrFangers,350,"n Java Edition_ pillagers can spawn in illager patrols. Illager patrols spawn a maximum of five pillagers (weight 55) or vindicators (weight 27) up to 200 blocks away from a village on grass or sand with a block light level of 0‚Äì8 and a sky light level of 10‚Äì15. Illager patrols spawn naturally throughout the day or night but after 5 in-game days."
560650395467120641,SpiritFire,61,their spawn point is almost next to the server start position
560650537272475650,SpiritFire,67,i wondered if they got something i can destroy to make them go away
560650562824306719,BootrFangers,77,check if there is a villages 200 blocks away if not its probably a server bug
560650898205048835,SpiritFire,48,how by knowing there isa village will that help?
560650920606826517,{·èù·è¨·èí·è¶·èï},34,*wonder how that person got on...*
560651064857067556,SpiritFire,70,heh well i spose i could just restart the world i guess with a new one
560651151083831297,SpiritFire,69,shame you cant have a way to kil them off and make them not spawn tho

560651306440851469,WilliamBac,146,Hey guysNLI bought some NFAs for factions to boost power_ but now I can't login in to them after like a week or 2. Does Mojang still lock accounts?
560651320999149569,BootrFangers,93,maybe destroying an outpost if there is one might help but it doesnt offically say anywhere üòõ
560651565804027916,WilliamBac,92,I know it's against ToS_ but I onyl really used it once or twice_ and didn;t reallt abuse it
560651654890782734,SpiritFire,427,im pretty oldschool minecraft player. this new pillager thing is new to me since i havent played ina  while. first thing we did was kill the guys carrying flags a lot.. didnt sotp them from respwawning.. then i said.. hey see that wooden building. lets destrorey it. they died repeatedly while i used an axe and tore it down.. nope. they still respawning. but then i had that issue with the world so stopped to figure that out.

560651876392239140,WilliamBac,21,How can I avoid this?
560651883597791234,SpiritFire,63,k so that chunk thing is a known bug. cool im not crazy. thanks
560651888492544020,Steve‚Ñ¢,107,So I've been trying to open up Minecraft 1.4.2. However_ it crashes as soon as the old Mojang logo pops up.
560651983527346206,BootrFangers,49,yeah when it comes to snapshots servers are buggy
560651989856550914,whoms,55,Does it crash or stop responding? <@277571347016712192>
560651997909352449,WilliamBac,83,Like lets say I check up every couple of weeks_ how do i avoid Mojang keep locking?
560652007883538452,Steve‚Ñ¢,7,crashes
560652010047930378,SpiritFire,46,ill use a dif version instead of this snapshot
560652051529334789,Steve‚Ñ¢,42,should I send the log or the crash report?
560652121884852227,whoms,166,<@304757722786562048> You can't avoid Alts being locked_ they are illegal and against the ToS. Mojang locks accounts once they find out about them being used as alts.
560652229267161088,Steve‚Ñ¢,53,wait having more than one account is against the tos?
560652253950771210,whoms,116,Please paste the crashlog to https://paste.ubuntu.com click `Paste!` and send the link in here <@277571347016712192>
560652295344488448,whoms,50,<@277571347016712192> No its not_ Alts are though.
560652320988200960,WilliamBac,69,Yes_ but how do they detect them? I mean I really just need it rarely
560652332938035200,whoms,26,As in illegaly bought alts
560652376168595466,WilliamBac,26,what is "illegally bought"
560652417272643625,whoms,25,Alt accounts are illegal.
560652439850582046,WilliamBac,68,How do I buy leggally other than buying 300 bucks worth of accounts?
560652483651829770,whoms,37,`buying 300 bucks worth of accounts?`
560652517269045253,WilliamBac,14,10 account=300
560652520330887179,whoms,20,thats your only way.
560652626467880961,whoms,125,You can only buy Minecraft accounts from https://minecraft.net or via official gift codes_ everything else is agains the Eula
560653040114466845,BootrFangers,119,although for playstation I believe they plan to remove gift codes from shops so offical playstation store in the future
560653042459082756,whoms,155,<@277571347016712192> Try giving the old version its own directory via the Launcher. NLNLCheck this and create a new folder called (for example) oldminecraft
560653106531270687,Steve‚Ñ¢,2,kk
560653224181235724,SpiritFire,259,tell you what my mom is super annoyed at the pillagers. lol. i told her we would  start a new world and try to see if it puts them a bit furhter off from our start point. id like to be able to blow up anb oupost or something to make them quit spawning though.
560653273711771649,SpiritFire,56,or have a block you have to get rid of to make them stop
560653322105913344,{·èù·è¨·èí·è¶·èï},35,i thought it be steve running a mod
560653395552239620,Steve‚Ñ¢,34,oh no I don't have forge installed

560653479937572874,SpiritFire,42,were not running any mods or anything btw.
560653496471519232,BootrFangers,133,I think it may be implemented_ if not its always something you could leave as a suggestion at https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us
560653536254230538,Steve‚Ñ¢,35,yeah changing the game dir fixed it

560653632727547905,SpiritFire,127,well having pillagers on top of you that keep spawning... and not being bale to make them stop.. seems a bit problemaitc to me.
560653687383654400,SpiritFire,31,shouldnt even be a suggestion üòõ
560653722972192779,whoms,70,<@195294392079220738> Whats your exact problem with the Pillagers now?
560653736087912458,BootrFangers,28,im sure they have it planned
560653773756825602,whoms,67,Maybe its a known bug aswell_ snapshots tend to have lots of them üëÄ
560653789414162443,BootrFangers,38,There is no way to stop them attacking
560653824759431178,BootrFangers,13,too true haha
560653845341143040,SpiritFire,143,on the dedicated server i started today with the most recent snapshot... the pillagers are spawning right next tot he spawn point of the server
560653876605354000,SpiritFire,20,they keep killing us
560654022965723177,SpiritFire,52,i mean.. at least they shouldnt spawn so darn close.
560654107073839119,whoms,31,Does it happen with every seed?
560654126787067905,SpiritFire,52,and they keep coming back no matter how many we kill
560654129018437663,MEE6,62,Hey <@!195294392079220738>_ you just advanced to **level 3** !
560654136647876608,whoms,28,Or just this one particular?
560654169501990912,SpiritFire,33,i havent tried any other seed yet
560654228431962139,whoms,80,Well the pillager outpost can spawn close to spawn_ that doesnt seem to be a bug
560654332014624778,whoms,134,The absurd amounts of pillagers could be related to this_ although this is marked as Resolved https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-139818
560654333725638677,EigenBot,0,
560654343980974110,SpiritFire,105,like i saidl they should have a way to make them quit spawning. destopry something of theirs or whatever.
560654390915104777,{·èù·è¨·èí·è¶·èï},70,do they spawn in the exact same spot? maybe turn it to a pool of lava?
560654404643061770,SpiritFire,8,ah a bug
560654442509238313,BootrFangers,14,yeah many bugs
560654468195155979,BootrFangers,22,its snapshot after all
560654526323884032,SpiritFire,78,well thers about 6 that spawn. if i kill any they respawn a few seconds later.
560654552676696065,SpiritFire,38,so it does no good to try to kill them
560654612835729418,SpiritFire,43,if i use lava that might make a lag monster
560654657714782208,BootrFangers,102,worst case scenario you will have to create your main server world in an official game release version
560654670880833565,whoms,70,<@195294392079220738> Is there a village near to the pillager outpost?
560654702052900885,SpiritFire,29,we havent found a village yet
560654736055992320,whoms,16,Hmm alright_ odd
560654785783791636,SpiritFire,108,i had issues with the world not spawning blocks/chunks so i had us all stop playing till we figured that out
