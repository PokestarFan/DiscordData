558117586072633345,ProfessorValko,434,<@436621585882021891> The version from the Microsoft Store must be purchased separately. If you purchased Java Edition (your Mojang Account) before October 2018_ you might have a free code you can use to get it for free. <https://help.mojang.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2064007-minecraft-for-windows-10 >NLNLOnce you download it_ sign in to the Xbox App on Windows 10 and then the game will sign into your XBL account automatically.

558451545243385866,TheRedstoneScientist,148,I love that the first Minecraft achievement is still ‚ÄúGetting Wood‚Äù after all these years but you‚Äôd never get away with that in a Marketplace map xD
558453255500333056,Cib,99,Does the taking inventory achievement still exist. It's been so long since I've got the achievement
558455276169330696,AZUREstrand,89,If I have a problem with a specific marketplace item_ is this the place to post about it?
558455736707842048,AZUREstrand,568,the marketplace texture pack "odyssey: the sci-fi resource pack" which I bought only minutes after having the 1.10 update thrust upon my switch has a critical problem causing a seemingly randomized obkext to render around my character obsucring all vision whenever I look in the direction of specific entities_ making it unplayable. Also_ its's selling point (a custom music pack) doesn't work at all_ meaning no music in minecraft ever. Is this a 1.10 thing_ a Switch thing_ or a broken store item that somehow managed to get rated super highly before becoming a dud?
