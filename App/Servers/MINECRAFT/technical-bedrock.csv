558107356664299520,joey,30,why is this still in the store
558112369926995979,Planto,19,because it's good??
558114828024152093,ChoPapa,9,ThorsHand
558114926095499284,ChoPapa,29,Are there any bedrock devs on
558115889438916610,Colbax3000,48,I think it would be good if there was voice chat
558115932925329408,ChoPapa,92,Do you have any intentions to make it possible to build on top of the bedrock in the nether?
558117005291552769,Rob Leyak,44,So a lot of things don't work for the switch
558429570685206529,lukeeey,60,Was the super duper graphics pack images at E3 just renders?
558430616715001858,Winslade_,133,Anybody know why i can‚Äôt do /give @s written_book ? i‚Äôm trying to make a warps/command book and apparently written_book isn‚Äôt an item
558430693529485315,TheRedstoneScientist,26,You have to write the book
558430745547374603,TheRedstoneScientist,39,I believe it‚Äôs writable_book? Or empty?
558430756368809984,TheRedstoneScientist,14,I can‚Äôt recall
558430856016953355,Winslade_,49,so you can‚Äôt do custom books? no clickable links?
558431378488819742,Creeper113,80,It‚Äôs writable_book and what do you mean by ‚Äúcustom book‚Äù and ‚Äúclickable links‚Äù ?
558431501193052180,Sir Chaton,51,Links aren‚Äôt able to be put into minecraft text yet
558431936180256769,lukeeey,37,Clickable links in chat would be nice
558432120721113099,StealthyExpert,15,Won't be added.
558432151746510878,StealthyExpert,36,I'm like really sure about that one.
558432263034109952,StealthyExpert,79,since console mainly refering about xbox one won't even let external server ips
558432316578332682,StealthyExpert,54,so I doubt they would add support for clickable links.
558432502818275348,lukeeey,30,Windows 10 could still have it
558432966271827988,SpiritDehSpoopii,36,Having issues connecting to a server
558433064359821363,SpiritDehSpoopii,97,I keep getting "connecting to external server" but I let it run for 50 mins and it didn't connect
558433444896702484,Creeper113,438,Well I have a question (unrelatedly to books n server issues): I‚Äôm making a shop and I know how to make a shop where the first command block is /clear @p item/block 0 1 and the second would be  /give @p block/item. But even when I do that_ if the player still does not have the item from the first command block_ the second command block still gives the player an item?? So I need a new shop idea that works or revise the one I mentioned.
558433723247362048,SpiritDehSpoopii,12,Use /testfor
558433800170897438,SpiritDehSpoopii,78,Idk the way it completely works but use /testfor to get what your trying to do
558433939711328256,Creeper113,35,Replacing the first command block ?
558433991586480130,SpiritDehSpoopii,2,No
558434093428244521,SpiritDehSpoopii,68,The first command block should be a repeat with the command /testfor
558434139154415665,SpiritDehSpoopii,24,The 2nd should be /clear
558434175175360524,SpiritDehSpoopii,23,The 3rd should be /give
558434505157771264,Creeper113,11,Ok_ thanks!
558435084202672128,SpiritDehSpoopii,2,Np
558437048214618142,Dillon,261,Hey does anyone have some ideas on how I could make a player unhittable in survival or prevent getting smacked I added resteince effects to make them invincible but they still get smacked around anyone know any commands that prevent dmg being registered at all?
558437319430897693,Sprinkles,170,Depending on the circumstance_ you can prevent mobs from attacking players so they can't inflict damage. Zombies with weakness shouldn't be able to knock the player back.
558437496191582227,Dillon,28,its pvp which is the problem
558437571198189569,Dillon,39,unless u weak a player? that might work
558437630568693780,Sir Chaton,69,That could work_ but this is why we need to get a /permission command
558437850597687297,Dillon,7,Omg ...
558437878183755777,Dillon,30,weakening the player does work
558437884810756096,Dillon,8,thank u!
558437902833549322,Sprinkles,15,You're welcome!
558438416744710171,Iluvmegf,51,Do zombies that are drowned Drop tridents anymore ?
558439925595504640,Dillon,98,Um does anyone know of a way to make a clock with commands? Every idk 5 minutes something happens?
558439972093427712,Dillon,21,or is that impossible
558441491933167634,Dillon,25,oof I found it on YouTube
558441591484710958,Sprinkles,335,You can do that_ *thankfully* MCBE at least has dummy objectives. You can increase an entity's score (not sure if fake players exist) and execute if it hits a certain value. If a score increments 20 times per second_ you'd want to multiply the time in seconds you want to wait by twenty.NL`60 seconds * 20 ticks-per-second = 1200 ticks`
558441603413573633,jcdees24,81,what skin is on the front of the bedrock update page with the crossbow and shield
558442085829574668,Dillon,43,yeah I found a way to do it on the youtubes
558443486588829707,miayunnaise,201,Anyone else have this problem where you put a music disc in a jukebox but the music doesn't play? It says that it plays but I don't hear anything. My music volume is all the way up. Can I fix this? :')
558447601721016320,QwertyThePie,34,BE does have dummy objectives_ yes
558447618838102036,QwertyThePie,36,Although there's other ways to do it
558447751193690113,QwertyThePie,126,And fake players exist_ but aren't the best way to make a delayed timer like that since you can't execute off of them directly
558448398303232011,Sprinkles,28,Unfortunately not_ it seems.
558454158085324800,Zamtrios,104,Qll my friends are playing in a huge survival thing and I can't play because Switch version is broken :/
558454456543346718,Zamtrios,44,I really hope the multiplayer thing is fixed
558454510536753182,Zamtrios,29,And the whole game in general
558457527550083073,Moses213,33,Did they ruin auto village farms?
558457629396041747,Moses213,46,My cousin is on his switch and I‚Äôm my realm rn
558458130338676756,Zamtrios,27,A few people are unaffected
558458300069314565,Zamtrios,137,But a lot of switch users are experiencing lag on switch_ freezes_ crashes_ and in my case the inability to make it past the title screen
558459556481728543,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,40,I am badly I can't play it at this state

558461568413859842,Frogrotini,14,that dint work
558461627612004372,Zamtrios,17,Not sure then tbh
558461661883924481,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,100,Until this is fixed I've been playing Nintendo switch edition as I still have that version installed
558461756528132136,Frogrotini,45,same it is sad i can't play with other people
558461841542742029,Zamtrios,22,I'm stuck with nothing
558461921632714752,Zamtrios,42,I have to wait and pray that this is fixed
558467511776051230,YM9001,51,Oh thank god I'm not the only one with that problem
558467724133662722,YM9001,139,It's become really irritating. Apparently when it happens it freezes all of the console buttons including the home button and glitch button
558468089566461953,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,7,It does
558468090422099978,MEE6,62,Hey <@!221768323375955968>_ you just advanced to **level 4** !
558468139394793490,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,37,At first I thought my console crashed
558471157205041166,Datting,88,Does anyone know how to get the old texture pack back on the bedrock/windows 10 edition?
558471555936419880,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,43,As we speak a legacy pack is in development
558471698433835008,YM9001,55,Switch gets the end stick of odd performance issues tbh
558471782105874432,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,37,Ikr my weak phone has less lag issues
558471976532967449,YM9001,166,This bug_ 1.9 had slow loading for menus (it still has some when you pause the game)_ it could take up to a whole minute just to open a chest or crafting table in 1.9
558472045709492236,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,130,My phone can open the settings instantly but has low frame rate while my switch flat out takes a while 10 seconds to open settings
558472073903865857,YM9001,4,Yeah
558472135551483906,YM9001,62,The switch is more powerful than like 80% of phones people use
558472304087269388,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,105,Compared to how well Nintendo switch edition runs compared to bedrock on switch its obviously a big issue
558472451487694858,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,118,Even starting the game is different bedrock takes about a minute while switch edition takes 5 seconds or less at times
558472481879621653,YM9001,23,I hope a bug comes soon
558472531829587978,YM9001,43,The game is practically becoming unplayable
558472601991905301,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,4,Yeah
558472724297547776,YM9001,46,This bug apparently has like no effect on mobs
558472820884242433,YM9001,77,I was fighting a skeleton and a creeper (not anywhere close to me) blew me up
558473100098928640,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,4,Yeah
558473141702230017,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,46,It doesn't effect other players in game either
558473188099620889,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,42,For them you just freeze for a few seconds
558473273273352192,FluffyWolfLord üíöüê∫,78,They can hit you over and over once you unfreeze you take all the hits at once

558762939038040074,ZyteOfficial,17,That doesn't help
558763015185498146,Cuteness,147,<@304316075259199488> Bedrock and Java Edition are different. Most stuff you are thinking of are needing Bedrock Add-ons and / or the Scripting API
558763057229070362,Infektedskrpion,21,how could i get that?
558763158890610829,Cuteness,71,<@298966770382012427>  All that is ‚Ä¶ is just an `/execute` command -.-'

558763853874331648,Mello,65,So then if someone breaks a block how can it show a title command
558763996748972032,Mello,74,Like lets say I broke a piece of wood and a title @a title command pops up
558764053464481803,ZyteOfficial,126,You could constantly clone that block_ and take an observer output from the destination_ which leads to a /title command block

558825718293987341,Awesomous1564,161,Hey guys! Is there any way to go back to the old Minecraft textures on the Nintendo Switch edition? I prefer the old ones and it seems there's no way to go back.
558826020426481695,Steve25_,108,Unfortunatly_ No not unless you join a world that has a resource pack enabled that changes the textures back
558826063829008384,Steve25_,63,But a new legacy texture pack might come out on the marketplace
558826158544781333,Steve25_,64,My question from *Today at 9:32 PM* still wasn't answered though
558826727904903173,Steve25_,105,Well_ This is not what I was looking for at all_ For some reason I don't see anything about this command.
558827272434614272,saltyham,31,do switches use bedrock or java
558827317590491138,Awesomous1564,113,That's kinda dumb. I think there should just be a toggle switch under video or resource packs to use old textures
558827318387277844,saltyham,19,pretty sure bedrock
558827403871518720,Awesomous1564,37,Oh all newer consoles work on bedrock

558846925227425802,Stephen,28,This is really annoying.....
558847343982804993,Stephen,164,I'm trying to build a nether wart farm_ but as I start the collection system_ this happens .... is there no way to avoid having to turn this farm around 90 degrees?
558848859124531230,Stephen,82,I don't think there's any way around having to change the orientation of the farm?
558848938912776211,Sir Chaton,24,Not of the powered rails
558849335933009940,Stephen,126,<@211625072190947331> any suggestions how to overcome rail defaults? The adjacent powered rails are proving extremely stubborn
558849722710884352,silentwisperer,117,you have to extend the side ones_ make them 5 long_ put down the center rails_ then removed the extra ones on the end

558853555126272040,Airbear,15,That's illegal.
558854001219731456,Stephen,35,I think I might have figured it out

558855110411681802,Stephen,111,That is an extremely long and convoluted  process_  but it seems to be working.... thanks <@211625072190947331>

558858995746603008,silentwisperer,23,yep_ pretty typical lol
558859121194172417,silentwisperer,90,but if you know what your doing (i dont) the directionality of rails can be super useful:3

558872616811626496,Nintendo Gamer 51,294,I‚Äôm on Minecraft MCPE 1.10 iPhone 6s_ and with text-to-speech on_ it sounds like the old Siri voice. In previous versions_ it sounded like the new Siri voice until 1.4. This also occurred on my iPhone 6. The strange thing is_ it didn‚Äôt change for anyone else I know. Is there any way to fix it?
558994329415319583,Unix,120,Havent been on the realm in a few days maybe like a week? I was in the middle or intense cooking i hope it's still there

558995331539402792,Unix,128,As someone who's been playing for years noticing the new textures is pretty cool. The style isn't too bad or too far off either.
558995566936195084,Unix,179,Honestly of the updated texture pack fully covered all or most textures I don't know if I'd pick it or faithful. They both look like minecraft but their art direction is different

559061034074374144,Deoxys_0,306,If you have a world size that is restricted to 2016√ó2016 (126√ó126 chunks)....

559061919445811213,Deoxys_0,180,On 3DS? probably not lol; I don't like playing games on my phone and I do not own a Switch_ so 3DS is the ONLY "mobile" Minecraft I have; I do the full Java version on my PC though

559062173674897458,Deoxys_0,90,The 3DS version is written in C++ though; it probably doesn't apply to any of those things
559062175914786821,Gruva,54,this is like an admist version that does bedrock seeds
559062230323167262,QuinPlayzGamez,95,I go to the store to try and update my game on windows 10 and it doesn't show the update at all
559062349256851486,Deoxys_0,112,the only reason I asked in bedrock was because it also has limited world sizes based on the version you're using
559062426058752021,Gruva,174,there will be a away to use it to automatically search for seeds with those structures in the range of spawn. But to be honest it's beyond my abilities to use that part of it
559062606799700001,Deoxys_0,277,I really wish for any version of Minecraft that has limited world sizes_ they would add a setting that you can enable if you wanted that basically said "one of every main biome type and structure will spawn"; it may result in a weird looking map_ but it would be really helpful
559062607437365250,Gruva,105,<@413840989120102411> are you logged into the store with the same username that you bought the game with?

560599247280406538,Kapey,49,because trash bedrock PG devs wont fix their game
560600275862290442,Sir Chaton,98,There‚Äôs so many bugs that someone‚Äôs been able to make a full series on bedrock bugs called bugrock
560600327741767721,Kapey,183,when online doesnt even work on bedrock because NAT is strict and u need a rocket science degree and computer science router portforwarding mechanical keyboard knowledge to changew it
560600331797397504,Kapey,5,trash
560600385874821150,Sir Chaton,4,Nat?
560600504984666112,Kapey,52,xbox thing that determines whether u can play online
560600554943021056,Sir Chaton,8,Ah I see
560600622852734976,Kapey,0,
560600700409610397,Sir Chaton,21,That‚Äôs on Xbox right?
560600718692843521,Kapey,8,im on PC
560600733653794839,Sir Chaton,38,I haven‚Äôt had that issue on windows 10
560600740758814720,Sir Chaton,6,Oh oof
560600741161730069,Kapey,33,but for online u use xbox account
560600780596314112,Kapey,36,that info is from the xbox app on PC
560600839031488522,Sir Chaton,4,Damn
560600934993100840,Sir Chaton,100,I‚Äôd honestly love a large fixing update where they go through all the bug reports and fix everything
560601042073419887,Sir Chaton,106,The spawning rates_ spawning issues_ the inconsistency with redstone_ crashes and performance issues_ etc.
560601170390024221,Kapey,61,im just gonna dupe the stuff i lost from losing shulker boxes
560601208407064596,SupremeMortal,46,The inconsistencies in Redstone won't be fixed
560601269866332181,Sir Chaton,8,Why not?
560601323850956811,SupremeMortal,22,Because it's by design
560601360266035201,Sir Chaton,15,The randomness?
560601395821019139,Sir Chaton,18,That‚Äôs on purpose?
560601532052144162,SupremeMortal,72,Yes_ it due to the way it's stored so the Redstone can be more efficient
560601769483436033,Sir Chaton,114,So redstone runs better performance and memory wise because of the inconsistency of whether something works or not
560601869580501044,Kapey,48,flying machines stopping isnt intentional is it?
560601990988693527,Sir Chaton,53,If the chunks don‚Äôt load then they would stop I think
560602035985186833,Kapey,29,i afk next to it and it stops

560602137726550016,Gruva,34,maybe not by design but a casualty
560602547858046987,Sir Chaton,93,Alright but I‚Äôd still prefer a massive fixing update first instead of the new features coming
560602717530226699,Sir Chaton,23,Or at least both in one
560603757935591424,MrPiedPiper,94,I just found out about it whilst experimenting with my furnace system_ and it boggled my mind.

560625989177311232,Salt Grapes,25,<@535043464438611969> yes
560626010240974848,GuilloE15,2,Ok
560626044458106882,GuilloE15,34,First you have to go into settings
560626082986852353,GuilloE15,21,On the switch console
560626104164155412,GuilloE15,6,Not mc
560626119187890197,Salt Grapes,12,Keep going..
560626222892187669,GuilloE15,75,You have to make sure there is enough memory wherever you have mc installed
560626338717892620,GuilloE15,77,If you have an SD card with mc you should look out if the card has free space
560626458612072448,GuilloE15,96,If it's installed into the console storage you should see if it has at least 20 GB of free space
560626666729242625,Salt Grapes,122,<@535043464438611969> I have a 64gb micro SD card_ but Minecraft is installed onto system memory which has 4.3gb remaining
560626667891064842,MEE6,62,Hey <@!558683048141652009>_ you just advanced to **level 3** !
560626810719830017,GuilloE15,38,<@558683048141652009> that's the issue
560626932321091585,Salt Grapes,136,I previously had Minecraft installed onto the SD card but I reinstalled it onto internal memory because I thought it would fix the issue
560626966986752011,GuilloE15,2,No
560627035723137024,GuilloE15,17,Only slightly tho
560627195756806145,GuilloE15,69,You gotta change some settings if your gonna keep it on system memory
560627268691689527,Salt Grapes,18,Ok_ what settings?
560627370655219760,GuilloE15,15,System settings
560627527828242454,GuilloE15,79,You should find the accessibility option somewhere and change the screen filter
560627675400503333,GuilloE15,92,I don't remember if it was on the accessibility tab but you have to change the screen filter
560627949011730432,Salt Grapes,37,I can't find "Accessibility Settings"
560628137210413057,GuilloE15,2,Ok
560628263530266624,GuilloE15,74,If you can't find them then you should inject your Switch with more energy
560628567403397140,GuilloE15,227,Basically_ you need to inject your Switch with enough energy that it will create a black hole. This will transport your mc version into the past_ meaning you'll be able to play an mc version before the lag issue like 1.2 or 1.6
