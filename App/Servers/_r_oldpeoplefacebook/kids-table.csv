558869728097992724,meerkat,104,And the chemo is supposed to kill fast spreading cells (aka cancer) but also healthy cells unfortunately

558869751850336256,grack,8,yeah....
558869762646736959,rob,28,sort of a brute force attack
558869772209750017,grack,29,if you want my take on it tbh
558869787648851970,grack,36,i have done a little bit of research
558869821706469386,grack,54,and fasting during chemo protects the healthy cells...
558869860566695936,meerkat,7,um what
558869884998778882,rob,38,yeah but im sure his doctors know best
558869898798039041,grack,61,and differentiates the healthy cells from the cancer cells...
558869926824247316,grack,35,sugar is the food for cancer cells.
558869937427578880,meerkat,3,yes
558869966539980810,grack,27,so go no sugar for a while?
558869990846234634,meerkat,34,cancer loves sugar for some reason
558869993043787776,grack,20,maybe it would help?
558870024215855125,rob,30,if it only it were that simple
558870039810539553,grack,4,yeah
558870050858074115,grack,25,obviously it's not a cure
558870144433127425,grack,82,but people have reported feeling a lot stronger and a lot better on low carb diets
558870230953361411,meerkat,56,is starving a low-carb diet <:topkek:408112822409494528>

558870593387233311,meerkat,38,I hope my new gfx card shows up Monday
558870622671863818,rob,19,that would be sweet
558870628627775488,rob,16,what did you get
558870713382076426,meerkat,33,radeon rx 580 'cause it's cheaper
558870812090826773,rob,34,comparable to the card that i have
558870828599607306,rob,27,what do you currently have?
558870834220105739,meerkat,60,i don't know why amd is so much cheaper than intel & invidia
558870874116194304,rob,29,idk its always been like that
558870881783513109,meerkat,12,nvidia 750ti
558870897960943616,meerkat,8,it's old
558870941082320897,rob,92,the general thing i've always seen is AMD is cheaper but like more buggy and prone to issues
558870985978150932,meerkat,32,<:ThinkShrug:356705760488587264>
558871006811389953,rob,68,although that may have changed since i heard that nearly 7 years ago
558871033713524756,rob,39,dolores was saying they got much better
558871060225851413,rob,41,and some friends of mine swear by AMD now
558871117130104835,meerkat,92,it's funny_ i had the 750ti for a while_ and when i upgrade parts I never got a new gfx card
558871174835208212,rob,37,this should be a nice upgrade for you
558871186210029593,meerkat,39,got a new cpu and whatnot but not a gfx
558871294142316566,meerkat,95,and according to this bottleneck website_ my cpu shouldn't bottleneck the new gfx card too much
558871474736201778,meerkat,36,that's all i'm worried about reallyt
558871626494509057,rob,33,did you get it mostly for gaming?
558871629439172618,meerkat,38,"Average bottleneck percentage: 7.37%"
558871641543933952,meerkat,3,yes
558871717448253440,meerkat,30,the cpu is atleast 2 years old
558871792660512768,meerkat,140,*Intel Core i5-6600K @ 3.50GHz (Clock speed at 100%) with AMD Radeon RX 580 (Clock speed at 100%) x1 will produce only 7.37% of bottleneck.*
558871867461730324,rob,21,yeah you will be fine
558871917835059212,rob,36,my CPU is probably 4-5 years old now
558871980166873098,rob,91,i need to upgrade it but to do that i think i'll have to also get a new motherboard and RAM
