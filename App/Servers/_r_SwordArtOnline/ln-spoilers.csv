558117470926405635,misterpool,72,If reki knows whats good for him he'll find some way to have Eugeo in UR
558117490019008518,misterpool,7,or else
558117534105206787,misterpool,0,
558117662878597145,tiramisu,59,i'm probably gonna read UR with a record lack of enthusiasm
558117911265542145,misterpool,135,I wanna say ill read UR but i know i wont be able to make myself read it unless the full arc is translated cuz i hate waiting for stuff
558118052336500737,misterpool,126,ill just grudgingly watch the second half of ALI muttering "thats not eugeo" every time Asuna Leafa or Sinon show up on screen
558441167654748160,Makeishura,96,Eugeo's death happens so late into the fight. He dies and gives Kirito motivation to keep going.
558444355069935638,tiramisu,2,no
558444372136296459,tiramisu,27,he dies after quinella dies
558444712017788952,Alice Tsundere-Thirty,45,That‚Äôs the most tragic part about it honestly
558444761833406464,Alice Tsundere-Thirty,56,The fact that he‚Äôs still alive as Kirito fights Quinella
558445111617388575,tiramisu,4,yeah
558445184946274332,tiramisu,58,his death is like the key factor to kirito going vegetable
558445236289011713,tiramisu,83,so i really wouldn't say that ``He dies and gives Kirito motivation to keep going``
558451344315514885,Makeishura,101,He dies after the fight_ but he spurs Kirito on by transmuting his blood to form the blood rose sword
558451376959520772,Makeishura,36,or red rose sword. I forget the name
558778008685510707,misterpool,36,Admin can go jump off the 22nd floor
558779546477002753,tiramisu,68,people who say admin is best girl are just thinking with their dicks
558781061979439119,jj2018,11,Let‚Äôs fight
558781076655308843,jj2018,4,Jkjk

558781543921876995,EnzerPyro,79,People do still genuinely like and love the worst kinds of villains either way.
558819837191782401,Kirito Synthesis Thirty-Three,15,Quinella is Hot
558819866484932621,Kirito Synthesis Thirty-Three,34,But Asuna is my number 1 SAO Waifu
558819886294368267,Kirito Synthesis Thirty-Three,27,Quinella is number 2 though
558819900744007681,Kirito Synthesis Thirty-Three,17,Alics is number 3
