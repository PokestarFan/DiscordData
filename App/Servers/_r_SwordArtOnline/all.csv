559045268251869204,Pigroee,alicization-anime-spoilers,117,actually the moment I die inside isnt when I game and "disconnect" from the real world_ but more like leave the games

559045309251059712,Pigroee,alicization-anime-spoilers,80,like im good for hanging out if you just say the word and I hang out quite often

559045345439514665,StratusAsterion,sao-games,172,still kinda surprised though because I sorted by attack_ and demon Silica_ and Undine Asuna are higher than Tsukuyomi Sinon again despite again i find her doing more damage
559045426041585684,Pigroee,alicization-anime-spoilers,177,but I swear to god if some witch cursed me I have some games I could play for eternity that just have small actual worlds in them (ark multiplayer_ minecraft factions_ wow_ etc)
559045792690864129,Kiiba,sao-games,44,Bow characters have low attack stats overall
559045851922825268,jj2018,sao-only,40,But oh well time to watch kaguaya before
559047039959302154,Siggy,alicization-anime-spoilers,53,Nah. Just us megaweebs who watch the raw has seen it.
559049367890165770,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,77,People legit watch it raw without subs and enjoy it not understanding a word?
559049373707665429,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,3,wut
559049437918527488,Exedo,alicization-anime-spoilers,39,Some people can speak Japanese you know
559049458478874624,henryxo,alicization-anime-spoilers,55,you never know_ people learn japanese through anime uwu
559049532860661762,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,41,I'd assume a lot of the people here don't
559049776893526071,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,83,I mean between those who actually speak Japanese and those who have read the novels
559049830312181801,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,86,I wouldn't be surprised if a half decent number of people are willing to watch the raw
559049880308416526,Siggy,alicization-anime-spoilers,144,Most of us who do are LN readers_ so it's more curiosity regarding what was adapted. How far the episode went. Since we already know the content
559049903658237955,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,52,I've read the novels and still wouldn't watch it raw
559049945580306455,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,26,I probably would_ honestly
559050324409581599,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,136,Should still be against the rules to come in here and talk about the episode because it's aired somewhere else in the world without subs
559050394525892618,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,67,Pretty sure the channel is for the subbed episodes as they come out
559050412645416971,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,43,Well yes_ it is the *anime spoiler* channel
559050568325398598,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,154,And it's pretty pointless to discuss the anime_ even if you see the raw and had read the LN_ without having fully understanding the content of the episode
559050674999132161,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,72,It's just not unreasonable for people to view the raw_ if they so please
559050919610810380,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,135,I don't care if people watch the raw. It's just a channel for people to discuss the episode once the subbed episodes release on Crunchy
559050948140335127,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,33,Or wherever else they come out on
559051392128516096,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,57,Well yeah_ no one said they were going to discuss the raw
559051497883566080,Siggy,alicization-anime-spoilers,64,Yup. We are indeed not allowed to do that in this channel anyway
559051512605573120,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,38,I'm going off of what this person said

559051582226956289,Alice Tsundere-Thirty,alicization-anime-spoilers,19,It‚Äôs common decency
559051583262949379,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,21,Just reacting to that
559051707401633797,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,99,Of course it's common decency_ but we are talking about the internet here_ with ya know. Jack Asses
559051826884771840,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,82,I mean_ the regulars here are pretty certain of the unspoken rules for the channel
559051942291046411,Siggy,alicization-anime-spoilers,23,Well. Subs are out now.

560628687234531349,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,13,not the point
560628709598691387,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,35,Eugeo would've been a good balancer
560628754309840906,Tatsumaki,general,40,We're sorry to see you leaving_ Xhadius!
560628876146114562,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,72,Didn't realize friend groups required equal numbers of males and females

560629609234956293,Wooker4,alicization-anime-spoilers,18,That was hilarious
560630169711411201,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,49,you're twisting my words into straw man arguments
560630193501503488,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,37,I said Eugeo would be a good balancer
560630200732221440,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,4,why?
560630380491702322,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,150,because we definitely see a very close "bro" like relationship between the two that you would not find between Kirito and the rest of his friend group
560630436557094958,Wooker4,images,66,<@153080312992104449> I don't remember Kirito wielding a small boy
560630444589056014,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,5,False
560630457407111189,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,70,never did I say that a group needed equal numbers of males and females
560630515078529027,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,82,Eugeo would get sidelined just like every single other deuteragonist in the series
560630581164113930,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,20,and I would disagree
560630607428714506,CryoMarine,images,133,lol thats what i said to my wife when i told her zeek was mad the sword was bigger then him. "its like im just swinging Zeek around!"
560630611811893248,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,21,On the grounds of...?
560630662626017301,Wooker4,images,3,lol
560630714312163359,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,59,that Eugeo holds importance to Kirito on the level of Asuna
560630802480758802,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,90,if he were to remain the series_ I would think that he would be 3rd in terms of screentime
560630852627857410,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,80,I'm not sure what series you're reading_ but Asuna got sidelined pretty hard too
560630913097138187,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,25,UR is refocusing on Asuna
560630971905605663,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,44,or at least_ she is much more relevant there
560631041136787486,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,28,based on what we have so far
560631044047634442,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,26,Only took three story arcs
560631061919301642,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,4,and?
560631126457057282,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,7,anyways
560631173290917898,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,60,I'm not too hung up on Asuna_ so I don't care to discuss her
560631218140479518,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,98,Literally every other character gets shelved_ assuming Eugeo would be any different is nonsensical
560631270581862405,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,98,I just think that he would add a much more interesting dimension to the friendgroup than Alice did
560631318245933086,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,3,loo
560631325032448032,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,4,look
560631327926517800,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,82,Also_ to backtrack a bit_ I was not "twisting your words into straw man arguments"
560631382871769110,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,80,```NLDidn't realize friend groups required equal numbers of males and femalesNL```
560631404355125298,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,33,I never stated anything like this
560631407958032384,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,3,Yes
560631435241848844,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,39,but you chose to interpret it that ways
560631443164758028,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,4,*way
560631465902080003,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,23,which is a huge stretch

560631527214678020,Wooker4,untranslated-spoilers,132,im now imagining Eugeo_ Sinon_ Asuna_ and the rest sitting on a shelf and occasionally switching out with the rest wishing them luck
560631548160770089,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,3,yes
560631574949920769,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,41,I don't see what's wrong with what I said
560631629727531049,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,28,can I not state my opinions?
560631665702207508,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,126,How is the logical conclusion there anything but assuming that "balancer" refers to balancing the number of males and females?
560631814419644427,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,105,by "balancer" I wanted to insinuate that Eugeo and Kirito's brotherly relationship would change things up
560631886603485185,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,34,And you have *now* made that clear
560631903695273984,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,96,because it quite frankly is true that the majority of his friendgroup has feelings toward Kirito
560631959844421642,tiramisu,untranslated-spoilers,70,and Eugeo is just brotherly with him_ which you do not see with others
560631967528255491,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,74,But mine was the only logical conclusion based on your statements thus far
560632009983131655,ZeHaffen,untranslated-spoilers,89,>it quite frankly is true that the majority of his friendgroup has feelings toward Kirito
