559045127105150977,Relo,general,55,FUUUU DOES THIS MEAN IVE BEEN SUMMONED TO ANOTHER WORLD
559045239759962123,Kiiba,general,9,Well yeah

559045268251869204,Pigroee,alicization-anime-spoilers,117,actually the moment I die inside isnt when I game and "disconnect" from the real world_ but more like leave the games
559045286702481439,Kiiba,sao-games,14,Yeah that's it
559045309251059712,Pigroee,alicization-anime-spoilers,80,like im good for hanging out if you just say the word and I hang out quite often
559045318377996312,Relo,general,9,yeah true
559045345439514665,StratusAsterion,sao-games,172,still kinda surprised though because I sorted by attack_ and demon Silica_ and Undine Asuna are higher than Tsukuyomi Sinon again despite again i find her doing more damage
559045426041585684,Pigroee,alicization-anime-spoilers,177,but I swear to god if some witch cursed me I have some games I could play for eternity that just have small actual worlds in them (ark multiplayer_ minecraft factions_ wow_ etc)
559045792690864129,Kiiba,sao-games,44,Bow characters have low attack stats overall
559045851922825268,jj2018,sao-only,40,But oh well time to watch kaguaya before
559047039959302154,Siggy,alicization-anime-spoilers,53,Nah. Just us megaweebs who watch the raw has seen it.
559049367890165770,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,77,People legit watch it raw without subs and enjoy it not understanding a word?
559049373707665429,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,3,wut
559049437918527488,Exedo,alicization-anime-spoilers,39,Some people can speak Japanese you know
559049458478874624,henryxo,alicization-anime-spoilers,55,you never know_ people learn japanese through anime uwu
559049532860661762,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,41,I'd assume a lot of the people here don't
559049776893526071,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,83,I mean between those who actually speak Japanese and those who have read the novels
559049830312181801,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,86,I wouldn't be surprised if a half decent number of people are willing to watch the raw
559049880308416526,Siggy,alicization-anime-spoilers,144,Most of us who do are LN readers_ so it's more curiosity regarding what was adapted. How far the episode went. Since we already know the content
559049903658237955,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,52,I've read the novels and still wouldn't watch it raw
559049945580306455,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,26,I probably would_ honestly
559050324409581599,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,136,Should still be against the rules to come in here and talk about the episode because it's aired somewhere else in the world without subs
559050394525892618,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,67,Pretty sure the channel is for the subbed episodes as they come out
559050412645416971,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,43,Well yes_ it is the *anime spoiler* channel
559050568325398598,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,154,And it's pretty pointless to discuss the anime_ even if you see the raw and had read the LN_ without having fully understanding the content of the episode
559050674999132161,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,72,It's just not unreasonable for people to view the raw_ if they so please
559050919610810380,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,135,I don't care if people watch the raw. It's just a channel for people to discuss the episode once the subbed episodes release on Crunchy
559050948140335127,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,33,Or wherever else they come out on
559051392128516096,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,57,Well yeah_ no one said they were going to discuss the raw
559051497883566080,Siggy,alicization-anime-spoilers,64,Yup. We are indeed not allowed to do that in this channel anyway
559051512605573120,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,38,I'm going off of what this person said

559051582226956289,Alice Tsundere-Thirty,alicization-anime-spoilers,19,It‚Äôs common decency
559051583262949379,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,21,Just reacting to that
559051707401633797,NinjasebFan,alicization-anime-spoilers,99,Of course it's common decency_ but we are talking about the internet here_ with ya know. Jack Asses
559051826884771840,Alexan,alicization-anime-spoilers,82,I mean_ the regulars here are pretty certain of the unspoken rules for the channel
559051942291046411,Siggy,alicization-anime-spoilers,23,Well. Subs are out now.
559052067570712601,jj2018,alicization-anime-spoilers,3,Aye
