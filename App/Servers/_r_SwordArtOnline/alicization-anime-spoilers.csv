558469762766864394,kswizzel,114,I would‚Äôve laughed if one of those 2 used thier other than for a disrespectful attack before the dramatic swing üòÇüòÇ
558762340393287701,EnzerPyro,85,That sharp stick has been collecting Solus' light for almost 300 years now hasn't it?
558762393979715605,EnzerPyro,69,Doubly taking into consideration the behemoth of a tree it came from.
558766139489124352,Alexan,56,Yeah but who would be able to tell just by looking at it
558766322201133056,Alexan,143,"You use a wooden sword?"NL"Yeah_ but it's from a tree that literally absorbs everything holy around it in order to strengthen itself."NL"...Oh."
558766606612824254,„ÄåKirito„Äç,324,Okay_ so a friend is trying to argue with me that what Quinella did to Eugeo is sexual assault.NLNL     and like - what was sexual about it? aside from the fact that she stripped and poked around in his memories a bit NLNL     all she did was make him lay on her a little_ then boom remove core protection.NLNL  they did /nothing/
558766868270284801,„ÄåKirito„Äç,23,then he became a knight
558766871596498966,Alexan,88,We meme about it all the time_ but_ yeah_ Quinella did basically nothing sexual to Eugeo
558766918924763162,Alexan,68,Unless his pp got hard seeing her naked but she didn't *do* anything
558767037904846868,„ÄåKirito„Äç,42,Exactly_ she didn't do anything to do him.
558768344530944001,Siggy,40,Now_ she sure as hell violated his mind.
558768400181231616,Siggy,23,But no sexual stuff no.
558768938629201930,„ÄåKirito„Äç,78,There you go_ people are acting like that she raped him.NLNL   No no she did not
558769996726009866,kaantantr,135,Sexual Assault would require a sexual act. At most_ you can prosecute her for flashing_ but then again_ it's her private room ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
558770052284022784,kaantantr,55,Last I checked_ undressing in your room was not a crime
558770086387908609,Alexan,71,Eugeo only *almost* got wet_ but by then it was already bros before hos
558771446126608391,„ÄåKirito„Äç,104,Now here's a question_ how long did Kirito spend in the STL during his first dive?NLNL   during episode 1.

558831428515921951,Shitaku,28,unlike certain previous arcs
558831681239515147,Shitaku,62,and finally it no longer feels a useless addition to the story
