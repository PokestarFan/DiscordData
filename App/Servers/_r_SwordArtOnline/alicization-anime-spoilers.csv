558436519254425652,Føxy (DM for a good story),45,but not the struggles of them getting it down
558436556537593867,Føxy (DM for a good story),20,or the thought of it
558437785942491157,Alexan,89,It would've been cool if we actually saw that handshake build up throughout the two cours
558438341184323634,『💕Kirito Kun💕』,25,this gif is a bit clearer
558438382997602304,tiramisu,15,they're so cute

558469762766864394,kswizzel,114,I would’ve laughed if one of those 2 used thier other than for a disrespectful attack before the dramatic swing 😂😂
558762340393287701,EnzerPyro,85,That sharp stick has been collecting Solus' light for almost 300 years now hasn't it?
558762393979715605,EnzerPyro,69,Doubly taking into consideration the behemoth of a tree it came from.
558766139489124352,Alexan,56,Yeah but who would be able to tell just by looking at it
558766322201133056,Alexan,143,"You use a wooden sword?"NL"Yeah_ but it's from a tree that literally absorbs everything holy around it in order to strengthen itself."NL"...Oh."
558766606612824254,「Kirito」,324,Okay_ so a friend is trying to argue with me that what Quinella did to Eugeo is sexual assault.NLNL     and like - what was sexual about it? aside from the fact that she stripped and poked around in his memories a bit NLNL     all she did was make him lay on her a little_ then boom remove core protection.NLNL  they did /nothing/
558766868270284801,「Kirito」,23,then he became a knight
558766871596498966,Alexan,88,We meme about it all the time_ but_ yeah_ Quinella did basically nothing sexual to Eugeo
558766918924763162,Alexan,68,Unless his pp got hard seeing her naked but she didn't *do* anything
558767037904846868,「Kirito」,42,Exactly_ she didn't do anything to do him.
558768344530944001,Siggy,40,Now_ she sure as hell violated his mind.
558768400181231616,Siggy,23,But no sexual stuff no.
558768938629201930,「Kirito」,78,There you go_ people are acting like that she raped him.NLNL   No no she did not
558769996726009866,kaantantr,135,Sexual Assault would require a sexual act. At most_ you can prosecute her for flashing_ but then again_ it's her private room ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
558770052284022784,kaantantr,55,Last I checked_ undressing in your room was not a crime
558770086387908609,Alexan,71,Eugeo only *almost* got wet_ but by then it was already bros before hos
558771446126608391,「Kirito」,104,Now here's a question_ how long did Kirito spend in the STL during his first dive?NLNL   during episode 1.
558784714899456001,kaantantr,11,> 10 daysNL🤔
558784749603389500,kaantantr,31,You mean "years" by any chance?
558814025346187274,Blayke Stelar,92,So_ just finished episode 18_ does 18.5 have any new info or anything that I'll want to see?
558814086754992149,Hardy,10,not really
558814976953942020,Blayke Stelar,21,Alright_ I'll skip it
558816111962095617,Alice Tsundere-Thirty,92,If you like seeing clips from previous episodes with filters on them_ go ahead and watch it.
558819692857393172,Kirito Synthesis Thirty-Three,37,I am excited about tomorrow's episode

558831240711766016,Shitaku,63,I'm pretty sure that's my only reason for visiting this channel
558831280377298946,Alexan,26,The jailbait of a lifetime
558831399139016705,Shitaku,52,it's all new and exciting and not at all predictable
558831428515921951,Shitaku,28,unlike certain previous arcs
558831681239515147,Shitaku,62,and finally it no longer feels a useless addition to the story
558831736234967041,Shitaku,60,so I wanna see what other people think otherwise it's no fun
558838921132245002,Hardy,64,Cant wait to see the reaction for this week episode and next one

559045268251869204,Pigroee,117,actually the moment I die inside isnt when I game and "disconnect" from the real world_ but more like leave the games
559045309251059712,Pigroee,80,like im good for hanging out if you just say the word and I hang out quite often
559045426041585684,Pigroee,177,but I swear to god if some witch cursed me I have some games I could play for eternity that just have small actual worlds in them (ark multiplayer_ minecraft factions_ wow_ etc)
559047039959302154,Siggy,53,Nah. Just us megaweebs who watch the raw has seen it.
559049367890165770,NinjasebFan,77,People legit watch it raw without subs and enjoy it not understanding a word?
559049373707665429,NinjasebFan,3,wut
559049437918527488,Exedo,39,Some people can speak Japanese you know
559049458478874624,henryxo,55,you never know_ people learn japanese through anime uwu
559049532860661762,NinjasebFan,41,I'd assume a lot of the people here don't
559049776893526071,Alexan,83,I mean between those who actually speak Japanese and those who have read the novels
559049830312181801,Alexan,86,I wouldn't be surprised if a half decent number of people are willing to watch the raw
559049880308416526,Siggy,144,Most of us who do are LN readers_ so it's more curiosity regarding what was adapted. How far the episode went. Since we already know the content
559049903658237955,NinjasebFan,52,I've read the novels and still wouldn't watch it raw
559049945580306455,Alexan,26,I probably would_ honestly
559050324409581599,NinjasebFan,136,Should still be against the rules to come in here and talk about the episode because it's aired somewhere else in the world without subs
559050394525892618,NinjasebFan,67,Pretty sure the channel is for the subbed episodes as they come out
559050412645416971,Alexan,43,Well yes_ it is the *anime spoiler* channel
559050568325398598,Alexan,154,And it's pretty pointless to discuss the anime_ even if you see the raw and had read the LN_ without having fully understanding the content of the episode
559050674999132161,Alexan,72,It's just not unreasonable for people to view the raw_ if they so please
559050919610810380,NinjasebFan,135,I don't care if people watch the raw. It's just a channel for people to discuss the episode once the subbed episodes release on Crunchy
559050948140335127,NinjasebFan,33,Or wherever else they come out on
559051392128516096,Alexan,57,Well yeah_ no one said they were going to discuss the raw
559051497883566080,Siggy,64,Yup. We are indeed not allowed to do that in this channel anyway
559051512605573120,NinjasebFan,38,I'm going off of what this person said
559051515331870723,NinjasebFan,0,
559051549649928214,Siggy,13,Yup. Exactly.
559051564862537730,NinjasebFan,18,Idk if someone did
559051582226956289,Alice Tsundere-Thirty,19,It’s common decency
559051583262949379,NinjasebFan,21,Just reacting to that
559051707401633797,NinjasebFan,99,Of course it's common decency_ but we are talking about the internet here_ with ya know. Jack Asses
559051826884771840,Alexan,82,I mean_ the regulars here are pretty certain of the unspoken rules for the channel
559051942291046411,Siggy,23,Well. Subs are out now.
559052067570712601,jj2018,3,Aye
559052088009687060,Alexan,217,~~Unspoken rule 34: Although most screenshots of quinella would only be suitable for <#191976650848731136>_ because they're alicization spoilers you can post them here. As long as they're screenshots from the anime.~~
559052216611110913,Siggy,10,It begins.
559052252929720340,Alexan,11,wait no way
