558449695635144704,TwinSwords [Skill Connect],22,My ranking run is shit
558453434576142356,Arisu,41,says that with 28 seconds and zero damage
558453498098876434,Arisu,61,I don't think this guy understands what the word "shit" means
558459746701672448,TwinSwords [Skill Connect],41,It's shit in terms of a veteran F2P's run
558807421515071508,TwinSwords [Skill Connect],0,
558815929224658960,Shitaku,4,nice
558816310889283615,Shitaku,50,I wanted that Yuuki as well but all I got was Rain
558816385254293514,Shitaku,53,Who if I remember correctly is actually really useful
558820413157801985,StratusAsterion,50,funny i just pulled the Sinon & Sugu from that set
558822989920075778,TwinSwords [Skill Connect],39,<@352858201596624898> she isn't anymore
558822999248207892,TwinSwords [Skill Connect],8,Too slow
558823009188577321,TwinSwords [Skill Connect],10,Low damage
558824956063121408,Shitaku,3,Oof
558825083121172484,Shitaku,87,Well_ she'll be my second dual wielder and she can do decent damage once I level her up
558826412606226453,Alice Tsundere-Thirty,81,I don’t care what anyone says_ Celestial Dancer Yuuki is a great dual blades char
558862606832762891,Flood_,0,
558862725317394442,Flood_,61,Holy shit the method I used to get this run was utter dogshit
558866051262316555,TwinSwords [Skill Connect],4,lmao
558867035602419713,Flood_,58,Yo TwinSwords you wanna hear the hell I had to go through?
558867170998747136,Arisu,25,technically he'll read it
558867253173551115,Flood_,127,The dogshit method I just pulled off required hitting **ALL CRITS** with SS3 hits and 3/4 of my autoattacks had to be Crits too
558867348900282382,Flood_,45,And UWKiritov1 doesn't have an All Crit skill
558867389949935626,Arisu,44,that's literally the method I use every time
558867429967659008,Arisu,20,except I take damage
558867566592786433,Flood_,39,It took me 100 runs just to get a Sub38
558867588571201566,Flood_,12,Jesus Christ
558867675216871435,Arisu,23,well I'll have a go now
558867707601354763,Arisu,31,let's see how badly I get rapef
559045096767488040,StratusAsterion,82,ah i found how to check_ it was just lvl_ so probably randomized all my level 80's
559045286702481439,Kiiba,14,Yeah that's it
559045345439514665,StratusAsterion,172,still kinda surprised though because I sorted by attack_ and demon Silica_ and Undine Asuna are higher than Tsukuyomi Sinon again despite again i find her doing more damage
559045792690864129,Kiiba,44,Bow characters have low attack stats overall
560285647831826443,Relo,3,^^^
560285686952099841,Kirito Synthesis Thirty-Three,24,I already unlocked Eugeo

560962651505819659,FiveAtOnce,46,I could wait for anniv3 asuna if it came to it
560980377775243284,EnzerPyro,79,Hm_ I kinda was answering in Five’s place if your question was directed at him.
560981185552187392,EnzerPyro,23,Perhaps any Sachi_ too.
560981691674656788,FiveAtOnce,11,OOOOOOOHHHH
560981757952917505,FiveAtOnce,72,Camisole units as in units wearing camisole dresses or shirts or whatevs
560981881890406403,EnzerPyro,90,No way anyone other than the usual girls is getting something_ and then maybe Rain &Seven.
560981892334354473,tiramisu,23,that sounds kinda basic
560981918502354944,tiramisu,34,and also that sounds like no Eugeo
560982008013258753,FiveAtOnce,25,Eugeo wearing camisole..?
