559078043067613196,emil_jacob,33,Or you can join the Wikia server.
559078180212703242,emil_jacob,87,There's a Polish dude there who has everything upto Vol. 19 (he will get Vol. 20 soon).
559093457025630218,Alice Tsundere-Thirty,11,he wins yes
559112568359354400,misterpool,88,eugeo should be having flashbacks every time he fights about him teaching eugeo the move
559112585719578630,misterpool,26,then crying for 2 chapters
559112590253359106,tiramisu,67,it's just unrealistic for kirito to not think about eugeo that much
559112601179783169,misterpool,23,then continue the story
559112609480310799,misterpool,5,facts
559112655974039555,「Kirito」,102,I dunno maybe we will during more of ur.NL   he probably thinks about him every day_ let's be real here
559112691248136192,tiramisu,110,I was expecting him to always be like "eugeo would've liked this" or "he would've reacted to this in that way"
559112711741374476,misterpool,2,^^
559112993636352000,misterpool,88,like his conciousness is still somewhere cuz it was shown in item storage to save kirito
559114855983087618,tiramisu,104,I'm partly mad because Eugeo wasn't at least remembered as a major hero the way SK and SQ and Alice were
560623945980837888,misterpool,46,because they didnt have enough waifu potential
560623992407326720,misterpool,65,smh ill say it a million times_ alice shouldve died in UW instead
560627966892179456,tiramisu,44,^ i'm sorry but i second this wholeheartedly
560628197159600131,tiramisu,97,i am so sick of the "another female joins Kirito's troupe" thing that prevails through the series
560628642321793024,ZeHaffen,43,Kirito has friends with vaginas_ how horrid
