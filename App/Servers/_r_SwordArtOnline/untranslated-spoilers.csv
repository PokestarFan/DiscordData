559077944727830579,So Dumb,92,that was my very abridged version but can give you a better recap if you actualy want it lol
559078043067613196,emil_jacob,33,Or you can join the Wikia server.
559078180212703242,emil_jacob,87,There's a Polish dude there who has everything upto Vol. 19 (he will get Vol. 20 soon).
559093457025630218,Alice Tsundere-Thirty,11,he wins yes
559112568359354400,misterpool,88,eugeo should be having flashbacks every time he fights about him teaching eugeo the move
559112585719578630,misterpool,26,then crying for 2 chapters
559112590253359106,tiramisu,67,it's just unrealistic for kirito to not think about eugeo that much
559112601179783169,misterpool,23,then continue the story
559112609480310799,misterpool,5,facts
559112655974039555,「Kirito」,102,I dunno maybe we will during more of ur.NL   he probably thinks about him every day_ let's be real here
559112691248136192,tiramisu,110,I was expecting him to always be like "eugeo would've liked this" or "he would've reacted to this in that way"
559112711741374476,misterpool,2,^^
559112993636352000,misterpool,88,like his conciousness is still somewhere cuz it was shown in item storage to save kirito
559114855983087618,tiramisu,104,I'm partly mad because Eugeo wasn't at least remembered as a major hero the way SK and SQ and Alice were
560623945980837888,misterpool,46,because they didnt have enough waifu potential
560623992407326720,misterpool,65,smh ill say it a million times_ alice shouldve died in UW instead
560627966892179456,tiramisu,44,^ i'm sorry but i second this wholeheartedly
560628197159600131,tiramisu,97,i am so sick of the "another female joins Kirito's troupe" thing that prevails through the series
560628642321793024,ZeHaffen,43,Kirito has friends with vaginas_ how horrid
560628687234531349,tiramisu,13,not the point
560628709598691387,tiramisu,35,Eugeo would've been a good balancer
560628876146114562,ZeHaffen,72,Didn't realize friend groups required equal numbers of males and females
560630169711411201,tiramisu,49,you're twisting my words into straw man arguments
560630193501503488,tiramisu,37,I said Eugeo would be a good balancer
560630200732221440,tiramisu,4,why?
560630380491702322,tiramisu,150,because we definitely see a very close "bro" like relationship between the two that you would not find between Kirito and the rest of his friend group
560630444589056014,ZeHaffen,5,False
560630457407111189,tiramisu,70,never did I say that a group needed equal numbers of males and females
560630515078529027,ZeHaffen,82,Eugeo would get sidelined just like every single other deuteragonist in the series
560630581164113930,tiramisu,20,and I would disagree
560630611811893248,ZeHaffen,21,On the grounds of...?
560630714312163359,tiramisu,59,that Eugeo holds importance to Kirito on the level of Asuna
560630802480758802,tiramisu,90,if he were to remain the series_ I would think that he would be 3rd in terms of screentime
560630852627857410,ZeHaffen,80,I'm not sure what series you're reading_ but Asuna got sidelined pretty hard too
560630913097138187,tiramisu,25,UR is refocusing on Asuna
560630971905605663,tiramisu,44,or at least_ she is much more relevant there
560631041136787486,tiramisu,28,based on what we have so far
560631044047634442,ZeHaffen,26,Only took three story arcs
560631061919301642,tiramisu,4,and?
560631126457057282,tiramisu,7,anyways
560631173290917898,tiramisu,60,I'm not too hung up on Asuna_ so I don't care to discuss her
560631218140479518,ZeHaffen,98,Literally every other character gets shelved_ assuming Eugeo would be any different is nonsensical
560631270581862405,tiramisu,98,I just think that he would add a much more interesting dimension to the friendgroup than Alice did
