560600369164451880,Zel,241,Hi.  Most games work on a system that means the code that runs the game and determines damage is separated from the code that renders the game on your screen.  It makes multi-threading the game easier and makes it run smoother.  Just saying.
560600893565698059,Banh Mi Dac Biet,145,Apexâ€™s issue is due to their server tickrate. It tries to give you a high tick rate but falls to 30% of its max due to inefficient data transfer.
560601015838048262,Banh Mi Dac Biet,105,Itâ€™s not FPS dependent but rather the server not knowing how to handle different loads and ping properly.
