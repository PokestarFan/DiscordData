561003249960878101,Supermassive,312,I think there might be a minion retargeting bug that happens randomly. My minions kept retargeting to other minions even when none of them moved/other minions came in. And no_ there weren't any taunt/decoy minions. It's pretty minor but it did just stop my ghost from capturing a minion which cost me the game...
561004750074544140,Thighlander,16,what about stun?
561004770853388290,Thighlander,14,or black hole?
