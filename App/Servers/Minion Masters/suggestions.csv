560626689437335563,Ciunay_Ragathol,106,Nice matchmaking as usual: three times against the same player with bad matchup for me_ in Draft mode. GG.
560627401193816066,Quezel,26,thats just how draft works
560627416503156747,Quezel,23,not a matchmaking issue
560628703466487819,Ciunay_Ragathol,48,in fact it's not an issue_ just bad matchmaking.
560629476153884672,Jamez28,26,how many wins were you at?
560630003470172170,Ciunay_Ragathol,69,8 but still_ i got matched vs him at 3 or 4_ at 5 ot 6 and again at 8
560630020389994506,Ciunay_Ragathol,19,or 7 don't remember
560630068460650516,Ciunay_Ragathol,30,okay it's night time_ but damn
560630353191108641,Ciunay_Ragathol,132,make me wait a little more instead of matching me against the same match up. if your deck can't counter that deck you have no chance
560630394521911296,Ciunay_Ragathol,17,free wins for him
560630763348033537,Jamez28,67,yeah its almost a guarentee you run into the same guy after 8+ wins
560630832369369090,Jamez28,61,the system tries to find someone else at 8 then 7_ then 6 etc
560630908516958223,Jamez28,71,so if no one else is in draft its really easy to run into the same dude
