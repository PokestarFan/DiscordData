560287870422614026,Thighlander,bug_reports,49,you might want to consider restarting your client

560600831305449496,Zion,deckbuilding,53,Wow.  They're BOTH bad? <:sakuRIP:396801184540917766>
560600987824291870,Zion,deckbuilding,118,I knew Crakgul was bad_ but Caeleth too?  I thought the Divine Shield would be worth something_ but this is just fail.
560601153679786003,Xiniu,deckbuilding,116,Turns out Divine shield that happens AFTER you take damage and can be 100% denied by stun & blackhole isn't as great
560601181324312598,Xiniu,deckbuilding,38,Especially for 9 mana on a 600 HP body
560601271954964481,Zion,deckbuilding,39,May as well stick to the Brothers_ huh?
560601293521944600,Xiniu,deckbuilding,4,Yeah
560601456034709528,Zion,deckbuilding,81,One Mana more and no shield_ but you get two units with basically the same stats.
560601839653879818,Zion,deckbuilding,87,These "Leader Units" seem to just be a waste of space. <:gooderFail:450744503167352842>
560602133389508662,DX2,minion_masters_general,17,I hate long games
560602321663295518,Jamez28,deckbuilding,25,crakgul isnt that bad imo
560602335194382366,DX2,deckbuilding,31,if you really wanna try caeleth
560602382724235264,Zion,minion_masters_general,166,Eh.  It depends for me.  If it's an actually close game then yeah_ long or short_ I consider it legit.  If it's the enemy inducing Healing Cancer though_ not so much.
560602397454368788,DX2,deckbuilding,39,try healing him while he has the shield
560602440626339841,DX2,deckbuilding,41,this is the only thing that I can suggest
560602446448295946,DX2,deckbuilding,2,XD
560602468556341262,Zion,deckbuilding,56,That actually makes sense. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560602521731727370,DX2,deckbuilding,31,the doomcleaver is a bit better
560602543651291137,Jamez28,deckbuilding,68,5 sec divine shield_ priestess at 30/hps_ for a whopping 150 healing
560602557651877889,DX2,deckbuilding,30,its just hard to get his value
560602572390531083,Jamez28,deckbuilding,3,nah
560602610332205067,Jamez28,deckbuilding,26,hold Azali and BBB in hand
560602626904031232,Jamez28,deckbuilding,10,free value
560602656234668033,DX2,deckbuilding,1,ðŸ¤”
560602673133649931,Jamez28,deckbuilding,41,Better yet just hold BBB and play it at 0
560602703789817856,Jamez28,deckbuilding,41,0 mana every mana you spend summons a bat
560602704099934208,Xiniu,deckbuilding,62,The idea behind crakgul is not value_ it's about critical mass
560602741777367064,Xiniu,deckbuilding,75,Value doesn't matter if you just win because of your massive azali bbb play
560602769275355137,Jamez28,deckbuilding,11,pretty much
560602803303743493,DX2,minion_masters_general,41,I think games > 10 minutes should be ties
560602840515608579,DX2,minion_masters_general,22,as well as 0 - 0 games
560602873524912130,Jamez28,deckbuilding,95,its pretty hard to beat a 0 mana BBB into say a 5 mana Azali into another 5 mana worth of stuff
560602896010444811,Shizzy,minion_masters_general,43,Alright ya'll. I got a brain buster for you
560602904705237002,Shizzy,minion_masters_general,88,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/298635437495418881/560597420027936809/unknown.png
560602957150683138,Shizzy,minion_masters_general,82,See that little video window in the right of his discord? How do we get rid of it?
560603025664901146,Jamez28,deckbuilding,95,the wet dream is 0 mana BBB into 0 Mana Azali into Morgruls Ragers_ and some other 5 mana cards
560603275263737866,Xiniu,deckbuilding,52,0 mana bbb into 0 mana azali into crakgul at 11 mana
560603759139618817,Zerkish,minion_masters_general,39,normally we don't go that high in games
560604187025473546,Francisco,minion_masters_general,27,<:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560604617579298856,Zerkish,minion_masters_general,79,so it just feels weird_ like there are bots in the ranked ladder or something..
560604629591654430,Sentry,minion_masters_general,38,can you guys put screen shots on here?
560604634813562880,DX2,deckbuilding,17,until they cost 0
560611451010809886,Thighlander,deckbuilding,81,so he takes a really long time to remove if they don't have enough control or dps
560620920788484098,Phoenix0917,minion_masters_general,15,stun lancers OP
560621842738577408,DX2,minion_masters_general,25,you know what is more op?
560621862233571328,DX2,minion_masters_general,10,blood imps
560621948774907907,DX2,minion_masters_general,67,you play them and the match ends faster <:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560622279869071405,Norklav,minion_masters_general,46,why do people never have like starting minions
560622312961998879,Norklav,minion_masters_general,69,they always just hoard all the 6-10 mana minions and hope for the win
560622443832541185,Norklav,minion_masters_general,40,it really feels like bots play this game
560623754083041282,AJman14,minion_masters_general,17,What do you mean?
560624484671946752,which_ get v-buck or ro-buck?,suggestions,35,Make match making more quicker hehe
560626100028440631,Norklav,minion_masters_general,58,idk solo matches end in one minute it's so easily winnable
560626122837065738,Norklav,minion_masters_general,42,only team matches seem challenging kind of
560626143854854160,AJman14,minion_masters_general,23,what league are you at?
560626183084048384,Norklav,minion_masters_general,49,i think i was at gold now im playing team matches
560626378417111045,AJman14,minion_masters_general,119,Yeah_ that's the problem. Get to master/grand master then talk about it. Low league players are low league for a reason
560626458674987039,Quezel,minion_masters_general,90,blood imps are very OP reduce your game time by 50% guaranteed <:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560626609883840533,Norklav,minion_masters_general,7,yeah ik
560626689437335563,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,106,Nice matchmaking as usual: three times against the same player with bad matchup for me_ in Draft mode. GG.
560626689961361408,Thighlander,minion_masters_general,51,https://clips.twitch.tv/HealthyTenuousSageBCWarrior
560627401193816066,Quezel,suggestions,26,thats just how draft works
560627416503156747,Quezel,suggestions,23,not a matchmaking issue
560627544383291414,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,24,contrary to what you saw
560627563152539648,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,23,datenshi lost that game
560628703466487819,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,48,in fact it's not an issue_ just bad matchmaking.
560628979569131537,Phoenix0917,minion_masters_general,29,how does that happen exactly?
560629476153884672,Jamez28,suggestions,26,how many wins were you at?
560629627891089426,Thighlander,minion_masters_general,15,luck is a skill
560630003470172170,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,69,8 but still_ i got matched vs him at 3 or 4_ at 5 ot 6 and again at 8
560630020389994506,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,19,or 7 don't remember
560630068460650516,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,30,okay it's night time_ but damn
560630353191108641,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,132,make me wait a little more instead of matching me against the same match up. if your deck can't counter that deck you have no chance
560630394521911296,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,17,free wins for him
560630562428026892,the_red_soul,minion_masters_general,76,he used screaming scrat and screaming scrat kills all units on explosion lol
560630763348033537,Jamez28,suggestions,67,yeah its almost a guarentee you run into the same guy after 8+ wins
560630803034406930,AJman14,minion_masters_general,33,no_ he used combustion_ I thought
560630832369369090,Jamez28,suggestions,61,the system tries to find someone else at 8 then 7_ then 6 etc
560630908516958223,Jamez28,suggestions,71,so if no one else is in draft its really easy to run into the same dude
560631315049742342,Zion,minion_masters_general,74,I wonder if Screaming Scrat can hit the Tower if you use Netherstep on it.
560631358154735636,DX2,minion_masters_general,4,yeah
560631360390430721,AJman14,minion_masters_general,6,it can
560631378954158081,Zion,minion_masters_general,29,<:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560631389016293376,AJman14,minion_masters_general,22,or frenzy from ravager
560631430078529568,DX2,minion_masters_general,17,100 hp for 4 mana
560631497112027136,Zion,minion_masters_general,91,It's technically on the ground_ and Screaming Scrat hits all ground enemies upon exploding.
560631591886389275,DX2,minion_masters_general,29,its funny when you shield him
560631674438811657,Quezel,minion_masters_general,42,ive had a screaming scrat just hug a tower
560631690125639687,DX2,minion_masters_general,35,he just sits on the opponents tower
560631704872812555,Quezel,minion_masters_general,53,i forget how though im p sure it just got black holed
560631725898727434,Quezel,minion_masters_general,10,or shielde
560631727991554050,Quezel,minion_masters_general,4,dyea
560631732429258773,DX2,minion_masters_general,25,and do absolutely nothing
560631734623010826,Quezel,minion_masters_general,11,that was it
560631794270076958,DX2,minion_masters_general,10,poor scrat
560631839505645580,DX2,minion_masters_general,30,he just wanted to kill himself
560631914697064450,Zion,minion_masters_general,44,Yeah_ only one explosion_ then he's useless.
560631941389615124,DX2,minion_masters_general,7,I mean_
560631961794641940,DX2,minion_masters_general,18,he keeps screaming
560631983475130372,DX2,minion_masters_general,2,XD
560632049178902552,Zion,minion_masters_general,31,Also_ has anyone seen this yet:
560632061409624095,DX2,minion_masters_general,35,so at least he can be a distraction
560632131286466583,DX2,minion_masters_general,51,yeah_ I never have enough gold when its on the shop
560632181970698281,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,127,if i remember well_ in the past_ something like 7-8 months ago_ they said that was improved but looks like it's not so improved
560632260198662155,Zion,minion_masters_general,59,I waited over a month for it. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560632325210374154,Zion,minion_masters_general,44,I hoarded the gold just so I could get this.
560632337528913930,Thighlander,minion_masters_general,3,lol
