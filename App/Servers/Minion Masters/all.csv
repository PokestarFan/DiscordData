560287870422614026,Thighlander,bug_reports,49,you might want to consider restarting your client
560287919772925984,Cyberaapje,bug_reports,16,lol ok good idea

560600831305449496,Zion,deckbuilding,53,Wow.  They're BOTH bad? <:sakuRIP:396801184540917766>
560600987824291870,Zion,deckbuilding,118,I knew Crakgul was bad_ but Caeleth too?  I thought the Divine Shield would be worth something_ but this is just fail.
560601153679786003,Xiniu,deckbuilding,116,Turns out Divine shield that happens AFTER you take damage and can be 100% denied by stun & blackhole isn't as great
560601181324312598,Xiniu,deckbuilding,38,Especially for 9 mana on a 600 HP body
560601271954964481,Zion,deckbuilding,39,May as well stick to the Brothers_ huh?
560601293521944600,Xiniu,deckbuilding,4,Yeah
560601456034709528,Zion,deckbuilding,81,One Mana more and no shield_ but you get two units with basically the same stats.
560601839653879818,Zion,deckbuilding,87,These "Leader Units" seem to just be a waste of space. <:gooderFail:450744503167352842>
560602133389508662,DX2,minion_masters_general,17,I hate long games
560602321663295518,Jamez28,deckbuilding,25,crakgul isnt that bad imo
560602335194382366,DX2,deckbuilding,31,if you really wanna try caeleth
560602382724235264,Zion,minion_masters_general,166,Eh.  It depends for me.  If it's an actually close game then yeah_ long or short_ I consider it legit.  If it's the enemy inducing Healing Cancer though_ not so much.
560602397454368788,DX2,deckbuilding,39,try healing him while he has the shield
560602440626339841,DX2,deckbuilding,41,this is the only thing that I can suggest
560602446448295946,DX2,deckbuilding,2,XD
560602468556341262,Zion,deckbuilding,56,That actually makes sense. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560602521731727370,DX2,deckbuilding,31,the doomcleaver is a bit better
560602543651291137,Jamez28,deckbuilding,68,5 sec divine shield_ priestess at 30/hps_ for a whopping 150 healing
560602557651877889,DX2,deckbuilding,30,its just hard to get his value
560602572390531083,Jamez28,deckbuilding,3,nah
560602610332205067,Jamez28,deckbuilding,26,hold Azali and BBB in hand
560602626904031232,Jamez28,deckbuilding,10,free value
560602656234668033,DX2,deckbuilding,1,ðŸ¤”
560602673133649931,Jamez28,deckbuilding,41,Better yet just hold BBB and play it at 0
560602703789817856,Jamez28,deckbuilding,41,0 mana every mana you spend summons a bat
560602704099934208,Xiniu,deckbuilding,62,The idea behind crakgul is not value_ it's about critical mass
560602741777367064,Xiniu,deckbuilding,75,Value doesn't matter if you just win because of your massive azali bbb play
560602769275355137,Jamez28,deckbuilding,11,pretty much
560602803303743493,DX2,minion_masters_general,41,I think games > 10 minutes should be ties
560602840515608579,DX2,minion_masters_general,22,as well as 0 - 0 games
560602873524912130,Jamez28,deckbuilding,95,its pretty hard to beat a 0 mana BBB into say a 5 mana Azali into another 5 mana worth of stuff
560602896010444811,Shizzy,minion_masters_general,43,Alright ya'll. I got a brain buster for you
560602904705237002,Shizzy,minion_masters_general,88,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/298635437495418881/560597420027936809/unknown.png
560602957150683138,Shizzy,minion_masters_general,82,See that little video window in the right of his discord? How do we get rid of it?
560603025664901146,Jamez28,deckbuilding,95,the wet dream is 0 mana BBB into 0 Mana Azali into Morgruls Ragers_ and some other 5 mana cards
560603275263737866,Xiniu,deckbuilding,52,0 mana bbb into 0 mana azali into crakgul at 11 mana
560603759139618817,Zerkish,minion_masters_general,39,normally we don't go that high in games
560604187025473546,Francisco,minion_masters_general,27,<:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560604617579298856,Zerkish,minion_masters_general,79,so it just feels weird_ like there are bots in the ranked ladder or something..
560604629591654430,Sentry,minion_masters_general,38,can you guys put screen shots on here?
560604634813562880,DX2,deckbuilding,17,until they cost 0
560611451010809886,Thighlander,deckbuilding,81,so he takes a really long time to remove if they don't have enough control or dps
560620920788484098,Phoenix0917,minion_masters_general,15,stun lancers OP
560621842738577408,DX2,minion_masters_general,25,you know what is more op?
560621862233571328,DX2,minion_masters_general,10,blood imps
560621948774907907,DX2,minion_masters_general,67,you play them and the match ends faster <:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560622279869071405,Norklav,minion_masters_general,46,why do people never have like starting minions
560622312961998879,Norklav,minion_masters_general,69,they always just hoard all the 6-10 mana minions and hope for the win
560622443832541185,Norklav,minion_masters_general,40,it really feels like bots play this game
560623754083041282,AJman14,minion_masters_general,17,What do you mean?
560624484671946752,which_ get v-buck or ro-buck?,suggestions,35,Make match making more quicker hehe
560626100028440631,Norklav,minion_masters_general,58,idk solo matches end in one minute it's so easily winnable
560626122837065738,Norklav,minion_masters_general,42,only team matches seem challenging kind of
560626143854854160,AJman14,minion_masters_general,23,what league are you at?
560626183084048384,Norklav,minion_masters_general,49,i think i was at gold now im playing team matches
560626378417111045,AJman14,minion_masters_general,119,Yeah_ that's the problem. Get to master/grand master then talk about it. Low league players are low league for a reason
560626458674987039,Quezel,minion_masters_general,90,blood imps are very OP reduce your game time by 50% guaranteed <:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560626609883840533,Norklav,minion_masters_general,7,yeah ik
560626689437335563,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,106,Nice matchmaking as usual: three times against the same player with bad matchup for me_ in Draft mode. GG.
560626689961361408,Thighlander,minion_masters_general,51,https://clips.twitch.tv/HealthyTenuousSageBCWarrior
560627401193816066,Quezel,suggestions,26,thats just how draft works
560627416503156747,Quezel,suggestions,23,not a matchmaking issue
560627544383291414,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,24,contrary to what you saw
560627563152539648,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,23,datenshi lost that game
560628703466487819,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,48,in fact it's not an issue_ just bad matchmaking.
560628979569131537,Phoenix0917,minion_masters_general,29,how does that happen exactly?
560629476153884672,Jamez28,suggestions,26,how many wins were you at?
560629627891089426,Thighlander,minion_masters_general,15,luck is a skill
560630003470172170,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,69,8 but still_ i got matched vs him at 3 or 4_ at 5 ot 6 and again at 8
560630020389994506,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,19,or 7 don't remember
560630068460650516,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,30,okay it's night time_ but damn
560630353191108641,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,132,make me wait a little more instead of matching me against the same match up. if your deck can't counter that deck you have no chance
560630394521911296,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,17,free wins for him
560630562428026892,the_red_soul,minion_masters_general,76,he used screaming scrat and screaming scrat kills all units on explosion lol
560630763348033537,Jamez28,suggestions,67,yeah its almost a guarentee you run into the same guy after 8+ wins
560630803034406930,AJman14,minion_masters_general,33,no_ he used combustion_ I thought
560630832369369090,Jamez28,suggestions,61,the system tries to find someone else at 8 then 7_ then 6 etc
560630908516958223,Jamez28,suggestions,71,so if no one else is in draft its really easy to run into the same dude
560631315049742342,Zion,minion_masters_general,74,I wonder if Screaming Scrat can hit the Tower if you use Netherstep on it.
560631358154735636,DX2,minion_masters_general,4,yeah
560631360390430721,AJman14,minion_masters_general,6,it can

560631389016293376,AJman14,minion_masters_general,22,or frenzy from ravager
560631430078529568,DX2,minion_masters_general,17,100 hp for 4 mana
560631497112027136,Zion,minion_masters_general,91,It's technically on the ground_ and Screaming Scrat hits all ground enemies upon exploding.
560631591886389275,DX2,minion_masters_general,29,its funny when you shield him
560631674438811657,Quezel,minion_masters_general,42,ive had a screaming scrat just hug a tower
560631690125639687,DX2,minion_masters_general,35,he just sits on the opponents tower

560631732429258773,DX2,minion_masters_general,25,and do absolutely nothing
560631734623010826,Quezel,minion_masters_general,11,that was it
560631794270076958,DX2,minion_masters_general,10,poor scrat
560631839505645580,DX2,minion_masters_general,30,he just wanted to kill himself
560631914697064450,Zion,minion_masters_general,44,Yeah_ only one explosion_ then he's useless.
560631941389615124,DX2,minion_masters_general,7,I mean_
560631961794641940,DX2,minion_masters_general,18,he keeps screaming
560631983475130372,DX2,minion_masters_general,2,XD
560632049178902552,Zion,minion_masters_general,31,Also_ has anyone seen this yet:
560632061409624095,DX2,minion_masters_general,35,so at least he can be a distraction
560632131286466583,DX2,minion_masters_general,51,yeah_ I never have enough gold when its on the shop
560632181970698281,Ciunay_Ragathol,suggestions,127,if i remember well_ in the past_ something like 7-8 months ago_ they said that was improved but looks like it's not so improved
560632260198662155,Zion,minion_masters_general,59,I waited over a month for it. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560632325210374154,Zion,minion_masters_general,44,I hoarded the gold just so I could get this.
560632337528913930,Thighlander,minion_masters_general,3,lol
560632568706367489,Zion,minion_masters_general,22,Still worth it for me.
560632920117739530,Zion,minion_masters_general,51,I guess you could call it a personal status symbol.
560633206353690648,DX2,minion_masters_general,22,I call it p2w arena XD
560633271495688212,Zion,minion_masters_general,29,<:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560633624366415892,Zion,minion_masters_general,99,That'd probably be the Supreme Arenas worth Rubies.  The Treasure Vault has always been Gold based.
560633812912963584,AJman14,minion_masters_general,41,no_ the p2w arena is the early access one
560633882202865664,Zion,minion_masters_general,33,The Classic Arena?  Got that too.
560635335638384640,DX2,minion_masters_general,25,I got that without paying

560635803013873670,AJman14,minion_masters_general,23,I have 420 hours played
560635898434289664,Zion,minion_masters_general,5,Nice.

560636714478207006,Zion,minion_masters_general,32,A little backup goes a long way.
560636826671382558,AJman14,minion_masters_general,67,yeah_ lock him onto a heavy unit_ then place light units to hit him
560636923002224651,AJman14,minion_masters_general,37,or even let him lock onto your master
560636979046383625,Zion,minion_masters_general,77,Divine Warrior makes a great distraction.  And yeah_ wait for face helps too.
560637405191995402,AJman14,minion_masters_general,44,Why did I have to like this kind of deck? xD

560640427934613532,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,40,depends on how you play your minions tbh
560640449425965059,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,34,if you stack them they die quicker
560640466249580545,AJman14,minion_masters_general,8,for sure
560640634851950592,AJman14,minion_masters_general,72,I was upset by the bug where combustion would kill my guarded healers xD

560640986729152543,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,83,I mean they arent going to not play a card when its only has one bugged interaction
560641059005399061,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,71,Combustion is pretty strong anyway since you cant counter the explosion
560641105457315854,DX2,minion_masters_general,24,I always used combustion
560641106279268367,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,39,you can counter it fine with black hole
560641141192654850,DX2,minion_masters_general,33,and im not going to stop using it
560641181168697344,DX2,minion_masters_general,32,just because it has a glitch uwu
560641237464383488,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,89,unless they nerfed the time to combust you have to predict the combust to stop it in time
560641283983409155,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,11,no you dont
560641313775550499,DX2,minion_masters_general,46,you need to be really fast to bhole combustion
560641347657138206,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,41,i counter it everygame when i can with BH
560641360105963531,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,28,its not as hard as you think
560641428364066826,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,3,sec
560641432038277141,DX2,minion_masters_general,37,considering you literally have 400 ms
560641442679357471,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,27,ill explain after this game
560641463520591892,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,11,some people
560641471426854912,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,15,play combustion
560641487847686154,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,24,then the minion after it
560641504369049608,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,12,like croaker
560641519380463616,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,28,but you can still counter it
560641555346489375,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,27,you dont need to predict it
560641622681845775,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,57,also_ i dont care those who use combustion in their decks
560641680521428995,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,108,its when certain players knowingly combust 1 living statue against a guardian healer just to kill the healer
560641756484337675,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,119,when if it wasnt bugged this would be worthless since it wouldnt kill anything and the healer would reheal the guardian
560641912491737098,DX2,minion_masters_general,56,I usually use it when there is a lot of minions together
560641954455748609,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,28,yea then youre not an abuser
560642249327902731,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,131,I mean considering you have <1 sec to counter the combustion_ you need to be pretty fast and having any latency makes it impossible
560642503133626381,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,67,theres a cast time + time when the minion is marked to then explode
560642588030533632,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,35,its really not as hard as you think
560642710474588210,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,15,try it sometime
560642758063161344,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,44,it definately makes it harder than 3 seconds
560642813356933132,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,132,you may not know this but every card has a .5 second delay before its playedNLand black hole has a 1 second delay before it activates
560642864493625344,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,56,combust activated after 1.5 seconds and explodes after 1
560642888376254494,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,14,you have 1 sec
560643019926405132,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,71,is it hard_ nah but for people with higher latency it can be impossible
560643236688035850,DX2,minion_masters_general,45,Or you use scripts<:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560643282867191818,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,33,how do i check my latency in game
560643519962677259,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,85,you would probably need an outside program since I dont this /showstats has that info
560643736023990272,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,93,but you can be matched up against people from any region so latency can be high in some cases
560643742223040522,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,37,/showstats does nothing for me ingame
560643851862147075,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,51,huh they mightve changed it or im remembering wrong
560643887753068574,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,34,ill ask fdm if its still available
560643899350188033,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,39,is there a command to see all commands?
560643930262077460,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,13,would be nice
560643945319759902,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,16,you can do /help
560643958527754241,Jamez28,minion_masters_general,21,but ti doesnt have it

560646204103458827,Mak,deckbuilding,20,i've seen some in gm
560646360446271488,Zion,deckbuilding,35,Thelec's only really good in teams.
560646492529098784,Mak,deckbuilding,48,well actually i saw it in solo but never in duo-
560646591061688360,Mak,deckbuilding,33,the trick is u use it with mordar
560646591959007233,Zion,deckbuilding,4,Huh.
560646614503653377,bait,minion_masters_general,0,
560646615229005857,Mak,deckbuilding,43,and even though they can dagger the archers
560646644702642217,Mak,deckbuilding,48,that means they then have to kill thelec himself
560646659772776459,Zion,deckbuilding,54,I guess the only "really" useless card is Dragon Nest.
560646664176533505,bait,minion_masters_general,23,finally got xiao dragon

560647872216039436,KuroTheDiscord,minion_masters_general,65,This is my first time becoming Grand Master. What does this mean?
560648007859830785,bait,minion_masters_general,9,your rank
560648030936760340,Zion,minion_masters_general,48,Congratulations.  You're now an official player.
560648140538249236,Thighlander,minion_masters_general,45,it means you are the 1054th best grand master
560648178857279488,SunWolf,guild-recruitment,84,I'm looking for a good alliance lvl 38 and on the climb but I make 26k+ per conquest
560648249363660844,KuroTheDiscord,minion_masters_general,25,Oh okay. That makes sense
560648283333328896,Thighlander,minion_masters_general,6,i mean
560648332486377473,Thighlander,minion_masters_general,63,you have 1053 divisions to climb before you reach grandmaster 1
560648520957296651,Zion,deckbuilding,75,I may actually try and set up those Empyrean and Voidborne decks for teams.
560648600313528330,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,1,^
560648600443682837,KuroTheDiscord,minion_masters_general,65,Whelp_ suddenly becoming Grand Master feels so underwhelming lmao
560648641761640448,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,45,means youre about 1/5th of the way to the top
560648877359759370,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,64,1054_ is this in premade 2s btw? if its in 2s relog and reset it
560649099481710593,Zion,minion_masters_general,55,Eh.  I still see Grand Master as the "Main" playerbase.
560649158332121098,Thighlander,minion_masters_general,62,there's still 1.2k random 2s grandmasters so far as i can tell
560650261933064192,KuroTheDiscord,minion_masters_general,20,It's in random teams
560650440648294452,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,23,relog just to make sure
560650466367635457,Dulcis,minion_masters_general,33,GM ranks bug out frequently in 2s
