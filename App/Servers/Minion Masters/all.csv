560287870422614026,Thighlander,bug_reports,49,you might want to consider restarting your client

560600831305449496,Zion,deckbuilding,53,Wow.  They're BOTH bad? <:sakuRIP:396801184540917766>
560600987824291870,Zion,deckbuilding,118,I knew Crakgul was bad_ but Caeleth too?  I thought the Divine Shield would be worth something_ but this is just fail.
560601153679786003,Xiniu,deckbuilding,116,Turns out Divine shield that happens AFTER you take damage and can be 100% denied by stun & blackhole isn't as great
560601181324312598,Xiniu,deckbuilding,38,Especially for 9 mana on a 600 HP body
560601271954964481,Zion,deckbuilding,39,May as well stick to the Brothers_ huh?
560601293521944600,Xiniu,deckbuilding,4,Yeah
560601456034709528,Zion,deckbuilding,81,One Mana more and no shield_ but you get two units with basically the same stats.
560601839653879818,Zion,deckbuilding,87,These "Leader Units" seem to just be a waste of space. <:gooderFail:450744503167352842>
560602133389508662,DX2,minion_masters_general,17,I hate long games
560602321663295518,Jamez28,deckbuilding,25,crakgul isnt that bad imo
560602335194382366,DX2,deckbuilding,31,if you really wanna try caeleth
560602382724235264,Zion,minion_masters_general,166,Eh.  It depends for me.  If it's an actually close game then yeah_ long or short_ I consider it legit.  If it's the enemy inducing Healing Cancer though_ not so much.
560602397454368788,DX2,deckbuilding,39,try healing him while he has the shield
560602440626339841,DX2,deckbuilding,41,this is the only thing that I can suggest
560602446448295946,DX2,deckbuilding,2,XD
560602468556341262,Zion,deckbuilding,56,That actually makes sense. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560602521731727370,DX2,deckbuilding,31,the doomcleaver is a bit better
560602543651291137,Jamez28,deckbuilding,68,5 sec divine shield_ priestess at 30/hps_ for a whopping 150 healing
560602557651877889,DX2,deckbuilding,30,its just hard to get his value
560602572390531083,Jamez28,deckbuilding,3,nah
560602610332205067,Jamez28,deckbuilding,26,hold Azali and BBB in hand
560602626904031232,Jamez28,deckbuilding,10,free value
560602656234668033,DX2,deckbuilding,1,ðŸ¤”
560602673133649931,Jamez28,deckbuilding,41,Better yet just hold BBB and play it at 0
560602703789817856,Jamez28,deckbuilding,41,0 mana every mana you spend summons a bat
560602704099934208,Xiniu,deckbuilding,62,The idea behind crakgul is not value_ it's about critical mass
560602741777367064,Xiniu,deckbuilding,75,Value doesn't matter if you just win because of your massive azali bbb play
560602769275355137,Jamez28,deckbuilding,11,pretty much
560602803303743493,DX2,minion_masters_general,41,I think games > 10 minutes should be ties
560602840515608579,DX2,minion_masters_general,22,as well as 0 - 0 games
560602873524912130,Jamez28,deckbuilding,95,its pretty hard to beat a 0 mana BBB into say a 5 mana Azali into another 5 mana worth of stuff
560602896010444811,Shizzy,minion_masters_general,43,Alright ya'll. I got a brain buster for you
560602904705237002,Shizzy,minion_masters_general,88,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/298635437495418881/560597420027936809/unknown.png
560602957150683138,Shizzy,minion_masters_general,82,See that little video window in the right of his discord? How do we get rid of it?
560603025664901146,Jamez28,deckbuilding,95,the wet dream is 0 mana BBB into 0 Mana Azali into Morgruls Ragers_ and some other 5 mana cards
560603275263737866,Xiniu,deckbuilding,52,0 mana bbb into 0 mana azali into crakgul at 11 mana
560603759139618817,Zerkish,minion_masters_general,39,normally we don't go that high in games
560604187025473546,Francisco,minion_masters_general,27,<:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560604617579298856,Zerkish,minion_masters_general,79,so it just feels weird_ like there are bots in the ranked ladder or something..
560604629591654430,Sentry,minion_masters_general,38,can you guys put screen shots on here?
560604634813562880,DX2,deckbuilding,17,until they cost 0
560611451010809886,Thighlander,deckbuilding,81,so he takes a really long time to remove if they don't have enough control or dps
