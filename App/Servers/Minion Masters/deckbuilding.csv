560600831305449496,Zion,53,Wow.  They're BOTH bad? <:sakuRIP:396801184540917766>
560600987824291870,Zion,118,I knew Crakgul was bad_ but Caeleth too?  I thought the Divine Shield would be worth something_ but this is just fail.
560601153679786003,Xiniu,116,Turns out Divine shield that happens AFTER you take damage and can be 100% denied by stun & blackhole isn't as great
560601181324312598,Xiniu,38,Especially for 9 mana on a 600 HP body
560601271954964481,Zion,39,May as well stick to the Brothers_ huh?
560601293521944600,Xiniu,4,Yeah
560601456034709528,Zion,81,One Mana more and no shield_ but you get two units with basically the same stats.
560601839653879818,Zion,87,These "Leader Units" seem to just be a waste of space. <:gooderFail:450744503167352842>
560602321663295518,Jamez28,25,crakgul isnt that bad imo
560602335194382366,DX2,31,if you really wanna try caeleth
560602397454368788,DX2,39,try healing him while he has the shield
560602440626339841,DX2,41,this is the only thing that I can suggest
560602446448295946,DX2,2,XD
560602468556341262,Zion,56,That actually makes sense. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560602521731727370,DX2,31,the doomcleaver is a bit better
560602543651291137,Jamez28,68,5 sec divine shield_ priestess at 30/hps_ for a whopping 150 healing
560602557651877889,DX2,30,its just hard to get his value
560602572390531083,Jamez28,3,nah
560602610332205067,Jamez28,26,hold Azali and BBB in hand
560602626904031232,Jamez28,10,free value
560602656234668033,DX2,1,ðŸ¤”
560602673133649931,Jamez28,41,Better yet just hold BBB and play it at 0
560602703789817856,Jamez28,41,0 mana every mana you spend summons a bat
560602704099934208,Xiniu,62,The idea behind crakgul is not value_ it's about critical mass
560602741777367064,Xiniu,75,Value doesn't matter if you just win because of your massive azali bbb play
560602769275355137,Jamez28,11,pretty much
560602873524912130,Jamez28,95,its pretty hard to beat a 0 mana BBB into say a 5 mana Azali into another 5 mana worth of stuff
560603025664901146,Jamez28,95,the wet dream is 0 mana BBB into 0 Mana Azali into Morgruls Ragers_ and some other 5 mana cards
560603275263737866,Xiniu,52,0 mana bbb into 0 mana azali into crakgul at 11 mana
560604634813562880,DX2,17,until they cost 0
560611451010809886,Thighlander,81,so he takes a really long time to remove if they don't have enough control or dps
560646160583229451,Mak,24,tbh thelec isn't too bad
560646204103458827,Mak,20,i've seen some in gm
560646360446271488,Zion,35,Thelec's only really good in teams.
560646492529098784,Mak,48,well actually i saw it in solo but never in duo-
560646591061688360,Mak,33,the trick is u use it with mordar
560646591959007233,Zion,4,Huh.
560646615229005857,Mak,43,and even though they can dagger the archers
560646644702642217,Mak,48,that means they then have to kill thelec himself
560646659772776459,Zion,54,I guess the only "really" useless card is Dragon Nest.
560646703418703887,Mak,35,no there's also that fireball thing
560646720493715458,Mak,13,fireball/heal
560646734141980672,Mak,2,ew
560646741876146186,Mak,6,*spit*
560646767796944917,Zion,15,Gambler's Ball?
560646777863143434,Mak,4,yeah
560646871614226443,Zion,8,...Well.
