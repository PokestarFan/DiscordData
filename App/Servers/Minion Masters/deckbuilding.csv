560600831305449496,Zion,53,Wow.  They're BOTH bad? <:sakuRIP:396801184540917766>
560600987824291870,Zion,118,I knew Crakgul was bad_ but Caeleth too?  I thought the Divine Shield would be worth something_ but this is just fail.
560601153679786003,Xiniu,116,Turns out Divine shield that happens AFTER you take damage and can be 100% denied by stun & blackhole isn't as great
560601181324312598,Xiniu,38,Especially for 9 mana on a 600 HP body
560601271954964481,Zion,39,May as well stick to the Brothers_ huh?
560601293521944600,Xiniu,4,Yeah
560601456034709528,Zion,81,One Mana more and no shield_ but you get two units with basically the same stats.
560601839653879818,Zion,87,These "Leader Units" seem to just be a waste of space. <:gooderFail:450744503167352842>
560602321663295518,Jamez28,25,crakgul isnt that bad imo
560602335194382366,DX2,31,if you really wanna try caeleth
560602397454368788,DX2,39,try healing him while he has the shield
560602440626339841,DX2,41,this is the only thing that I can suggest
560602446448295946,DX2,2,XD
560602468556341262,Zion,56,That actually makes sense. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560602521731727370,DX2,31,the doomcleaver is a bit better
560602543651291137,Jamez28,68,5 sec divine shield_ priestess at 30/hps_ for a whopping 150 healing
560602557651877889,DX2,30,its just hard to get his value
560602572390531083,Jamez28,3,nah
