560602133389508662,DX2,17,I hate long games
560602382724235264,Zion,166,Eh.  It depends for me.  If it's an actually close game then yeah_ long or short_ I consider it legit.  If it's the enemy inducing Healing Cancer though_ not so much.
560602803303743493,DX2,41,I think games > 10 minutes should be ties
560602840515608579,DX2,22,as well as 0 - 0 games
560602896010444811,Shizzy,43,Alright ya'll. I got a brain buster for you

560602957150683138,Shizzy,82,See that little video window in the right of his discord? How do we get rid of it?
560603759139618817,Zerkish,39,normally we don't go that high in games
560604187025473546,Francisco,27,<:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560604617579298856,Zerkish,79,so it just feels weird_ like there are bots in the ranked ladder or something..
560604629591654430,Sentry,38,can you guys put screen shots on here?
560620920788484098,Phoenix0917,15,stun lancers OP
560621842738577408,DX2,25,you know what is more op?
560621862233571328,DX2,10,blood imps
560621948774907907,DX2,67,you play them and the match ends faster <:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560622279869071405,Norklav,46,why do people never have like starting minions
560622312961998879,Norklav,69,they always just hoard all the 6-10 mana minions and hope for the win
560622443832541185,Norklav,40,it really feels like bots play this game
560623754083041282,AJman14,17,What do you mean?
560626100028440631,Norklav,58,idk solo matches end in one minute it's so easily winnable
560626122837065738,Norklav,42,only team matches seem challenging kind of
560626143854854160,AJman14,23,what league are you at?
560626183084048384,Norklav,49,i think i was at gold now im playing team matches
560626378417111045,AJman14,119,Yeah_ that's the problem. Get to master/grand master then talk about it. Low league players are low league for a reason
560626458674987039,Quezel,90,blood imps are very OP reduce your game time by 50% guaranteed <:Puffa:500302539468832788>

560627544383291414,Jamez28,24,contrary to what you saw
560627563152539648,Jamez28,23,datenshi lost that game
560628979569131537,Phoenix0917,29,how does that happen exactly?
560629627891089426,Thighlander,15,luck is a skill
560630562428026892,the_red_soul,76,he used screaming scrat and screaming scrat kills all units on explosion lol
560630803034406930,AJman14,33,no_ he used combustion_ I thought
560631315049742342,Zion,74,I wonder if Screaming Scrat can hit the Tower if you use Netherstep on it.
560631358154735636,DX2,4,yeah
560631360390430721,AJman14,6,it can
560631378954158081,Zion,29,<:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560631389016293376,AJman14,22,or frenzy from ravager
560631430078529568,DX2,17,100 hp for 4 mana
560631497112027136,Zion,91,It's technically on the ground_ and Screaming Scrat hits all ground enemies upon exploding.
560631591886389275,DX2,29,its funny when you shield him
560631674438811657,Quezel,42,ive had a screaming scrat just hug a tower
560631690125639687,DX2,35,he just sits on the opponents tower
560631704872812555,Quezel,53,i forget how though im p sure it just got black holed
560631725898727434,Quezel,10,or shielde
560631727991554050,Quezel,4,dyea
560631732429258773,DX2,25,and do absolutely nothing
560631734623010826,Quezel,11,that was it
560631794270076958,DX2,10,poor scrat
560631839505645580,DX2,30,he just wanted to kill himself
560631914697064450,Zion,44,Yeah_ only one explosion_ then he's useless.
560631941389615124,DX2,7,I mean_
560631961794641940,DX2,18,he keeps screaming
560631983475130372,DX2,2,XD
560632049178902552,Zion,31,Also_ has anyone seen this yet:
560632061409624095,DX2,35,so at least he can be a distraction
560632131286466583,DX2,51,yeah_ I never have enough gold when its on the shop
560632260198662155,Zion,59,I waited over a month for it. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560632325210374154,Zion,44,I hoarded the gold just so I could get this.
560632337528913930,Thighlander,3,lol
560632568706367489,Zion,22,Still worth it for me.
560632920117739530,Zion,51,I guess you could call it a personal status symbol.
560633206353690648,DX2,22,I call it p2w arena XD
560633271495688212,Zion,29,<:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560633624366415892,Zion,99,That'd probably be the Supreme Arenas worth Rubies.  The Treasure Vault has always been Gold based.
560633812912963584,AJman14,41,no_ the p2w arena is the early access one
560633882202865664,Zion,33,The Classic Arena?  Got that too.
560635335638384640,DX2,25,I got that without paying
560635339300143145,DX2,2,XD
560635391779274770,AJman14,9,same_ lol
560635687045431326,Zion,34,Been at this game for over a year.
560635767509090305,AJman14,25,It's addictive_ isn't it?
560635803013873670,AJman14,23,I have 420 hours played
560635898434289664,Zion,5,Nice.
560635955988660228,Zion,11,I'm at 470.
560636203771363328,AJman14,24,I play it super casually
560636226164621336,AJman14,24,Been here since mid 2017

560636396587581440,Zion,53,And meh.  Harbinger isn't too difficult to take down.
560636457111257121,Phoenix0917,3,how
560636574203772930,AJman14,58,beam of doom_ propeller scrats_ dragon ball_ a few gunners
560636603878473758,AJman14,11,many others
560636649202122795,Phoenix0917,6,thanks
560636714478207006,Zion,32,A little backup goes a long way.
560636826671382558,AJman14,67,yeah_ lock him onto a heavy unit_ then place light units to hit him
560636923002224651,AJman14,37,or even let him lock onto your master
560636979046383625,Zion,77,Divine Warrior makes a great distraction.  And yeah_ wait for face helps too.
560637405191995402,AJman14,44,Why did I have to like this kind of deck? xD
560637909523365919,Zion,27,<:Angry:311053992245460992>
560637933883883540,Zion,7,CANCER.
560638233063456768,Dulcis,14,looks familiar
560638270422253568,AJman14,44,ey_ at least I didn't have a stormy in there
560638466321416192,AJman14,65,Oh hi <@309097387014750218>... I may have played it against you ðŸ˜›
560638693342445571,Jamez28,48,all fun and games till you run into 2x memestorm
560639711245500427,Dulcis,82,i suppose its time to redeem all of the streamer packs i got to buy the arena haha
560639716689707018,Dulcis,2,jk
560639785081896970,AJman14,41,<@135811347035324416> I have a black hole
560639945245589505,Jamez28,2,2x
560640008080457728,AJman14,45,2-3 guardians in there would share the damage
560640027965521922,Dulcis,1,^
560640044428427285,AJman14,22,but yeah_ it's weak xD
560640074027630592,Jamez28,11,1800>2000 ðŸ¤”
560640090620297237,AJman14,36,I can ward off beam of doom at times
560640142008778777,Dulcis,3,sam
560640144974151681,Dulcis,1,e
560640371206520833,AJman14,57,+ healers in there + black hole to counter one meme storm
560640427934613532,Dulcis,40,depends on how you play your minions tbh
560640449425965059,Dulcis,34,if you stack them they die quicker
560640466249580545,AJman14,8,for sure
560640634851950592,AJman14,72,I was upset by the bug where combustion would kill my guarded healers xD
560640663561961521,AJman14,26,but I still won that match
560640715751817238,Dulcis,3,yea
560640733372088321,Dulcis,34,certain people abuse that mechanic
560640986729152543,Jamez28,83,I mean they arent going to not play a card when its only has one bugged interaction
560641059005399061,Jamez28,71,Combustion is pretty strong anyway since you cant counter the explosion
560641105457315854,DX2,24,I always used combustion
560641106279268367,Dulcis,39,you can counter it fine with black hole
560641141192654850,DX2,33,and im not going to stop using it
560641181168697344,DX2,32,just because it has a glitch uwu
560641237464383488,Jamez28,89,unless they nerfed the time to combust you have to predict the combust to stop it in time
560641283983409155,Dulcis,11,no you dont
560641313775550499,DX2,46,you need to be really fast to bhole combustion
560641347657138206,Dulcis,41,i counter it everygame when i can with BH
560641360105963531,Dulcis,28,its not as hard as you think
560641428364066826,Dulcis,3,sec
560641432038277141,DX2,37,considering you literally have 400 ms
560641442679357471,Dulcis,27,ill explain after this game
560641463520591892,Dulcis,11,some people
560641471426854912,Dulcis,15,play combustion
560641487847686154,Dulcis,24,then the minion after it
560641504369049608,Dulcis,12,like croaker
560641519380463616,Dulcis,28,but you can still counter it
560641555346489375,Dulcis,27,you dont need to predict it
560641622681845775,Dulcis,57,also_ i dont care those who use combustion in their decks
560641680521428995,Dulcis,108,its when certain players knowingly combust 1 living statue against a guardian healer just to kill the healer
560641756484337675,Dulcis,119,when if it wasnt bugged this would be worthless since it wouldnt kill anything and the healer would reheal the guardian
560641912491737098,DX2,56,I usually use it when there is a lot of minions together
560641954455748609,Dulcis,28,yea then youre not an abuser
560642249327902731,Jamez28,131,I mean considering you have <1 sec to counter the combustion_ you need to be pretty fast and having any latency makes it impossible
