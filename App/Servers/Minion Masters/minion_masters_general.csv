560602133389508662,DX2,17,I hate long games
560602382724235264,Zion,166,Eh.  It depends for me.  If it's an actually close game then yeah_ long or short_ I consider it legit.  If it's the enemy inducing Healing Cancer though_ not so much.
560602803303743493,DX2,41,I think games > 10 minutes should be ties
560602840515608579,DX2,22,as well as 0 - 0 games
560602896010444811,Shizzy,43,Alright ya'll. I got a brain buster for you

560602957150683138,Shizzy,82,See that little video window in the right of his discord? How do we get rid of it?
560603759139618817,Zerkish,39,normally we don't go that high in games

560604617579298856,Zerkish,79,so it just feels weird_ like there are bots in the ranked ladder or something..
560604629591654430,Sentry,38,can you guys put screen shots on here?

560621842738577408,DX2,25,you know what is more op?
560621862233571328,DX2,10,blood imps
560621948774907907,DX2,67,you play them and the match ends faster <:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560622279869071405,Norklav,46,why do people never have like starting minions
560622312961998879,Norklav,69,they always just hoard all the 6-10 mana minions and hope for the win
560622443832541185,Norklav,40,it really feels like bots play this game
560623754083041282,AJman14,17,What do you mean?
560626100028440631,Norklav,58,idk solo matches end in one minute it's so easily winnable
560626122837065738,Norklav,42,only team matches seem challenging kind of
560626143854854160,AJman14,23,what league are you at?
560626183084048384,Norklav,49,i think i was at gold now im playing team matches
560626378417111045,AJman14,119,Yeah_ that's the problem. Get to master/grand master then talk about it. Low league players are low league for a reason
560626458674987039,Quezel,90,blood imps are very OP reduce your game time by 50% guaranteed <:Puffa:500302539468832788>

560627563152539648,Jamez28,23,datenshi lost that game
560628979569131537,Phoenix0917,29,how does that happen exactly?
560629627891089426,Thighlander,15,luck is a skill
560630562428026892,the_red_soul,76,he used screaming scrat and screaming scrat kills all units on explosion lol
560630803034406930,AJman14,33,no_ he used combustion_ I thought
560631315049742342,Zion,74,I wonder if Screaming Scrat can hit the Tower if you use Netherstep on it.
560631358154735636,DX2,4,yeah
560631360390430721,AJman14,6,it can

560631430078529568,DX2,17,100 hp for 4 mana
560631497112027136,Zion,91,It's technically on the ground_ and Screaming Scrat hits all ground enemies upon exploding.
560631591886389275,DX2,29,its funny when you shield him
560631674438811657,Quezel,42,ive had a screaming scrat just hug a tower
560631690125639687,DX2,35,he just sits on the opponents tower
560631704872812555,Quezel,53,i forget how though im p sure it just got black holed

560631732429258773,DX2,25,and do absolutely nothing
560631734623010826,Quezel,11,that was it
560631794270076958,DX2,10,poor scrat
560631839505645580,DX2,30,he just wanted to kill himself
560631914697064450,Zion,44,Yeah_ only one explosion_ then he's useless.
560631941389615124,DX2,7,I mean_
560631961794641940,DX2,18,he keeps screaming
560631983475130372,DX2,2,XD
560632049178902552,Zion,31,Also_ has anyone seen this yet:
560632061409624095,DX2,35,so at least he can be a distraction
560632131286466583,DX2,51,yeah_ I never have enough gold when its on the shop
560632260198662155,Zion,59,I waited over a month for it. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560632325210374154,Zion,44,I hoarded the gold just so I could get this.
560632337528913930,Thighlander,3,lol
560632568706367489,Zion,22,Still worth it for me.
560632920117739530,Zion,51,I guess you could call it a personal status symbol.
560633206353690648,DX2,22,I call it p2w arena XD
560633271495688212,Zion,29,<:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560633624366415892,Zion,99,That'd probably be the Supreme Arenas worth Rubies.  The Treasure Vault has always been Gold based.
560633812912963584,AJman14,41,no_ the p2w arena is the early access one
560633882202865664,Zion,33,The Classic Arena?  Got that too.
560635335638384640,DX2,25,I got that without paying
560635339300143145,DX2,2,XD
560635391779274770,AJman14,9,same_ lol
560635687045431326,Zion,34,Been at this game for over a year.
560635767509090305,AJman14,25,It's addictive_ isn't it?
560635803013873670,AJman14,23,I have 420 hours played
560635898434289664,Zion,5,Nice.

560636649202122795,Phoenix0917,6,thanks
560636714478207006,Zion,32,A little backup goes a long way.
560636826671382558,AJman14,67,yeah_ lock him onto a heavy unit_ then place light units to hit him
560636923002224651,AJman14,37,or even let him lock onto your master
560636979046383625,Zion,77,Divine Warrior makes a great distraction.  And yeah_ wait for face helps too.
560637405191995402,AJman14,44,Why did I have to like this kind of deck? xD

560639711245500427,Dulcis,82,i suppose its time to redeem all of the streamer packs i got to buy the arena haha

560640008080457728,AJman14,45,2-3 guardians in there would share the damage
560640027965521922,Dulcis,1,^
560640044428427285,AJman14,22,but yeah_ it's weak xD
560640074027630592,Jamez28,11,1800>2000 ðŸ¤”
560640090620297237,AJman14,36,I can ward off beam of doom at times
560640142008778777,Dulcis,3,sam
560640144974151681,Dulcis,1,e
560640371206520833,AJman14,57,+ healers in there + black hole to counter one meme storm
560640427934613532,Dulcis,40,depends on how you play your minions tbh
560640449425965059,Dulcis,34,if you stack them they die quicker
560640466249580545,AJman14,8,for sure
560640634851950592,AJman14,72,I was upset by the bug where combustion would kill my guarded healers xD
560640663561961521,AJman14,26,but I still won that match
560640715751817238,Dulcis,3,yea
560640733372088321,Dulcis,34,certain people abuse that mechanic
560640986729152543,Jamez28,83,I mean they arent going to not play a card when its only has one bugged interaction
560641059005399061,Jamez28,71,Combustion is pretty strong anyway since you cant counter the explosion
560641105457315854,DX2,24,I always used combustion
560641106279268367,Dulcis,39,you can counter it fine with black hole
560641141192654850,DX2,33,and im not going to stop using it
560641181168697344,DX2,32,just because it has a glitch uwu
560641237464383488,Jamez28,89,unless they nerfed the time to combust you have to predict the combust to stop it in time
560641283983409155,Dulcis,11,no you dont
560641313775550499,DX2,46,you need to be really fast to bhole combustion
560641347657138206,Dulcis,41,i counter it everygame when i can with BH
560641360105963531,Dulcis,28,its not as hard as you think
560641428364066826,Dulcis,3,sec
560641432038277141,DX2,37,considering you literally have 400 ms
560641442679357471,Dulcis,27,ill explain after this game
560641463520591892,Dulcis,11,some people
560641471426854912,Dulcis,15,play combustion
560641487847686154,Dulcis,24,then the minion after it
560641504369049608,Dulcis,12,like croaker
560641519380463616,Dulcis,28,but you can still counter it
560641555346489375,Dulcis,27,you dont need to predict it
560641622681845775,Dulcis,57,also_ i dont care those who use combustion in their decks
560641680521428995,Dulcis,108,its when certain players knowingly combust 1 living statue against a guardian healer just to kill the healer
560641756484337675,Dulcis,119,when if it wasnt bugged this would be worthless since it wouldnt kill anything and the healer would reheal the guardian
560641912491737098,DX2,56,I usually use it when there is a lot of minions together
560641954455748609,Dulcis,28,yea then youre not an abuser
560642249327902731,Jamez28,131,I mean considering you have <1 sec to counter the combustion_ you need to be pretty fast and having any latency makes it impossible
560642503133626381,Dulcis,67,theres a cast time + time when the minion is marked to then explode
560642588030533632,Dulcis,35,its really not as hard as you think
560642710474588210,Dulcis,15,try it sometime
560642758063161344,Dulcis,44,it definately makes it harder than 3 seconds
560642813356933132,Jamez28,132,you may not know this but every card has a .5 second delay before its playedNLand black hole has a 1 second delay before it activates
560642864493625344,Jamez28,56,combust activated after 1.5 seconds and explodes after 1
560642888376254494,Jamez28,14,you have 1 sec
560643019926405132,Jamez28,71,is it hard_ nah but for people with higher latency it can be impossible
560643236688035850,DX2,45,Or you use scripts<:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560643282867191818,Dulcis,33,how do i check my latency in game
560643519962677259,Jamez28,85,you would probably need an outside program since I dont this /showstats has that info
560643736023990272,Jamez28,93,but you can be matched up against people from any region so latency can be high in some cases
560643742223040522,Dulcis,37,/showstats does nothing for me ingame
560643851862147075,Jamez28,51,huh they mightve changed it or im remembering wrong
560643887753068574,Jamez28,34,ill ask fdm if its still available
560643899350188033,Dulcis,39,is there a command to see all commands?
560643930262077460,Dulcis,13,would be nice
560643945319759902,Jamez28,16,you can do /help
560643958527754241,Jamez28,21,but ti doesnt have it

560648030936760340,Zion,48,Congratulations.  You're now an official player.
560648140538249236,Thighlander,45,it means you are the 1054th best grand master
560648249363660844,KuroTheDiscord,25,Oh okay. That makes sense
560648283333328896,Thighlander,6,i mean
560648332486377473,Thighlander,63,you have 1053 divisions to climb before you reach grandmaster 1

560648641761640448,Dulcis,45,means youre about 1/5th of the way to the top
560648877359759370,Dulcis,64,1054_ is this in premade 2s btw? if its in 2s relog and reset it
560649099481710593,Zion,55,Eh.  I still see Grand Master as the "Main" playerbase.
560649158332121098,Thighlander,62,there's still 1.2k random 2s grandmasters so far as i can tell
560650261933064192,KuroTheDiscord,20,It's in random teams
560650440648294452,Dulcis,23,relog just to make sure

560990269684842497,Meno,35,like_ it's one thing to incentivise
560990329696681984,EricisFreaker,8,whats cs
560990424957714442,Meno,116,but after the dball nerf then rabid prowler then crystal construct then batsbatsbats then shieldguard and now stormy
560990578796396546,Meno,162,there hasn't been a card release since WHEEL OF DOOM that hasn't had at least 1-3 cards in the release pool required to be drastically nerfed in a very short time
560990588711731202,Meno,16,let that sink in
560990709327593485,EricisFreaker,33,wait how is stormy getting nerfed
560990791846068224,Meno,48,he's already been nerfed via the guardian change
560990832274964501,Meno,51,and will almost certainly be nerfed again very soon
560999005690265620,EricisFreaker,0,
560999042364997634,EricisFreaker,11,3 times now

560999100997435415,EricisFreaker,31,1 from random legendary in shop

561003065696583681,DX2,70,<@230902648490950656> you forgot harbinger when he had an insane range
561003378411569162,Meno,14,yes_ yes I did
561003394798583811,DX2,75,But yeah I think devs should be more careful with what they add to the game
561003427614949378,Meno,26,it's not even more careful
561003447877632020,Meno,20,every. single. patch
561003492815405056,Meno,50,literally they need to actually playtest... at all
561003561081634816,DX2,61,Im really afraid with what is comming in the next battle pass
561003724403900426,DX2,41,I hope it will not be infinite stun decks
561003787678908417,Meno,17,of course it will
561003822281916417,DX2,25,<:Cry:311053991142227968>
561003990188425216,Meno,121,fyi I pretty much nagged on Reddit so hard on pre-release caleth being broken_ they nerfed it before it was even released
561004033054212097,Meno,61,it's becoming so predictable I saw it before it even happened
561004088087674881,Meno,51,next deck will essentially be a bunch more stormies
561004112314105877,Meno,12,aoe and para
561004145989910529,Meno,34,un-interactive "sit there and die"
561004160560922655,â˜…puesmiraâ˜…,8,spanish?
561004161500577812,EricisFreaker,4,wdym
561004177376018442,EricisFreaker,13,caleth is bad
561004190395269150,Meno,3,yes
561004216441896960,EricisFreaker,15,it needs a buff
561004229313953814,EricisFreaker,22,along with doomcleaver
561004239791587330,Meno,47,pre-release the shield would last half the time
561004240605151252,EricisFreaker,5,badly
561004281046630421,Meno,27,and the taunt was automatic
561004402932973608,Meno,111,they released it nerfing the taunt (required activators) and increasing reload time of shield from 10 to 12 sec
561004520839184395,EricisFreaker,34,caleth should have either hp boost
561004531807289364,EricisFreaker,18,or lower mana cost
561004537905807362,EricisFreaker,8,id say 7
561004570852065300,DX2,39,Shieldguard on the other hand is a hell
561004605052551168,EricisFreaker,22,shieldguard is a beast

561004677580455976,EricisFreaker,51,but i feel like they should readd double dmg charge
561004679081754649,DX2,69,You can't play any smal minion to counter it until hia shield is down
561004752616292373,EricisFreaker,37,caleth has stats of brothers of light
561004810791550977,EricisFreaker,27,but its still not that good
561004933550178362,DX2,39,Brothers of light is so easy to counter
561004958657282071,EricisFreaker,9,yeah true
561004985039585301,EricisFreaker,34,i only use it in my max glory deck
561005003985256458,EricisFreaker,22,for those juicy chests
561005055965265950,EricisFreaker,30,other thanthat i dont use them
561005079646437400,EricisFreaker,34,tbh 10 mana cards arent that great
561005696645201922,DX2,17,but they could be
561005822898077696,EricisFreaker,4,yeah
561005839264120853,EricisFreaker,20,colossus only 9 mana
561005854040653866,EricisFreaker,25,and is a really good tank
561005875356237826,EricisFreaker,9,troubador
561005881496567838,EricisFreaker,6,8 mana
