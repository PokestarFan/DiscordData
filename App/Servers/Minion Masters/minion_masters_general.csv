560602133389508662,DX2,17,I hate long games
560602382724235264,Zion,166,Eh.  It depends for me.  If it's an actually close game then yeah_ long or short_ I consider it legit.  If it's the enemy inducing Healing Cancer though_ not so much.
560602803303743493,DX2,41,I think games > 10 minutes should be ties
560602840515608579,DX2,22,as well as 0 - 0 games

560602957150683138,Shizzy,82,See that little video window in the right of his discord? How do we get rid of it?
560603759139618817,Zerkish,39,normally we don't go that high in games
560604187025473546,Francisco,27,<:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560604617579298856,Zerkish,79,so it just feels weird_ like there are bots in the ranked ladder or something..

560622312961998879,Norklav,69,they always just hoard all the 6-10 mana minions and hope for the win
560622443832541185,Norklav,40,it really feels like bots play this game
560623754083041282,AJman14,17,What do you mean?
560626100028440631,Norklav,58,idk solo matches end in one minute it's so easily winnable
560626122837065738,Norklav,42,only team matches seem challenging kind of
560626143854854160,AJman14,23,what league are you at?
560626183084048384,Norklav,49,i think i was at gold now im playing team matches
560626378417111045,AJman14,119,Yeah_ that's the problem. Get to master/grand master then talk about it. Low league players are low league for a reason
560626458674987039,Quezel,90,blood imps are very OP reduce your game time by 50% guaranteed <:Puffa:500302539468832788>
