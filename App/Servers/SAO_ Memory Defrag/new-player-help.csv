558107240809234434,mrshmeep,58,no i was asking which  is better to get sorry forgot comma
558107308396118019,Zylexia,257,yeah will give sinon +3% extra attack but that would end up at 432 I see at most for the attack when equipped to that wind sinon while the Leafa armor won't get the leafa +3% attack one though but will get the element bonus which will be 436 attack in total
558107383151329290,Iced Icicle,15,Sinon is better
558107497886515240,Iced Icicle,47,||and add some commas or periods on your wall||
558107902523473955,Zylexia,87,yeah sinon is better for sinon just forgot that sinon is 3% all attack increase for her
558108036791533578,Zylexia,30,which would beat the leafa one
558108561369202688,Zylexia,86,yeah thinking about that only better for leafa I see the leafa equipment being instead
558431184808443906,Vee,129,Will bamco let me regain access to an account just by having the transfer code_ being linked to gmail_ and I guess old passwords?
558431378190893057,NEETenshi,66,How does one link an acc to gmail <:AkariThink:419270590860623893>
558431423158157312,NEETenshi,32,You can only link it to fb afaik
558431527982202891,Vee,74,Idk it's for the google play mission things but it's not really linked lol
558431909911461897,NEETenshi,48,Does saomd have google play missions? First news
558432047509536768,NEETenshi,91,I play on android and all google takes part in is stealing my money and converting it to md
558432693147271168,Vee,183,The missions are just add x people and login_ nothing too important NLBut yeah_ as of right now I'm locked out of my acc unless bamco would just give me access again if that's possible
558433378278572043,NEETenshi,78,I believe there is a form you can fill and send to scamco to get your acc back
558433425241931816,NEETenshi,51,Go to the saomd support page and it should be there
558436072904720384,attinat,104,there are google play achievements but your google play account isn't actually linked to your MD account
558445289808330754,Raso,67,My first Memory fragments lol should I buy an armor? And which one?

558471280207069200,Kenthos,73,well_ honestly Idk what to do_ felt like a dumb mistake (going to step 5)
558473715281559573,attinat,69,anecdotes don't disprove the fact that step 6 is still more efficient
558473730251161610,attinat,29,it's getting there that isn't
558807108179591218,JTmoney09,145,What would be the best banner for a new player to pull on rn? I mean obv ill do em all for the discount but which would be the best one currently
558817882352386089,FiveAtOnce,45,not exacty easy to determine the "best" one..
558818201157500929,FiveAtOnce,92,if/when there was/will be one_ you'll know because the server's going to be ranting about it
558818638048657428,FiveAtOnce,71,if there is one_ youll know because the server will be ranting about it
558818703714680832,FiveAtOnce,26,otherwise_ theyre all good
558818754029420555,FiveAtOnce,28,(except most of the 5* ones)
558825880642650142,Dota3,64,I accidentally use 4 lvl 30 armor  to make a lvl 4 star armor TT
558825952084230146,Dota3,31,Is the new sinon or yuuki good?
558838076105949214,Kenthos,67,Why only one R2 Ring is available in the Minotaur event_ but 12 R3?
558838157890551809,Kenthos,29,Any point in getting this R2?
558838315135139850,iShootdown‚Ñ¢,17,The R2 is useless
558838368314589201,iShootdown‚Ñ¢,58,Unless you‚Äôre willing to get 12 copies just to make one R4
558838420231946251,iShootdown‚Ñ¢,55,Which takes up too many crystals and cols in my opinion
558839168277544961,Kenthos,8,Oki ty üòÉ
558841573878661151,Lanki,106,Also the r2 are unlimited in the quest its not just 1 x) but then again no need to go for it r3 more worth
558850322731368450,Milim Nava,78,what should i do after yuuki and asuna banner {thats my first banner ive done}
558991883993481236,br0wnies,42,Oh ok lol_ i am actually mentally retarded
558991916784549935,br0wnies,24,I'll just let myself out
558992422089130009,br0wnies,79,Are the no.3X quests different for everyone or is there a cheatsheet somewhere?
558992556281692162,NEETenshi,40,Those missiosn are for a different quest
558992634493009960,NEETenshi,66,"Friendly Match in Fairyland" is the quest that came out yesterday
558992655992881154,iShootdown‚Ñ¢,32,Quests are the same for everyone
558992716600705024,iShootdown‚Ñ¢,29,except for day-based missions
558992768119078942,NEETenshi,76,Also the timing for Eldrie/Eugeo is on the notice_ they rotate every 3 hours
558992859361968138,iShootdown‚Ñ¢,51,i.e. login for 100 days_ get 100 weapons from scout
558993000265678868,br0wnies,8,yeah_ ok
558993055319982080,NEETenshi,47,To be fair even those are the same for everyone
558993092359880704,NEETenshi,59,You just get them earlier or later depending on your logins
558994180521590795,iShootdown‚Ñ¢,81,just putting it there just in case some person blasted me for not mentioning that
558995170419277825,FiveAtOnce,32,When was the last water ranking?
558996184492933129,NEETenshi,36,At the end of November_ bath ranking
558996423518060546,FiveAtOnce,7,Oh okie
558996473971343360,FiveAtOnce,49,So that means that i can expect another one soon?
559001549859192857,Milim Nava,25,im not even suited for fc
559001591189995552,NEETenshi,36,don't worry about R5 armors early on
559001601843527682,attinat,99,<@130708054676209664> only problem with that site is the tier list <:KappaTrash:431105702153420810>
559001612060721191,Milim Nava,40,my only 5*'s are will kirito and dablice
559001621246246913,NEETenshi,55,just slowly farm MFs whenever possible until you get 50
559001703807189003,NEETenshi,75,tier lists are worthless in this game so just ignore <@!262780141485293569>
559001713793826827,NEETenshi,25,<:mmV:295974268913582080>
559001749029912576,Milim Nava,93,{am mad step 1 and 2 of the tof wep banner shafted  me {i dont have a single R3 1H sword ;-;}
559001829216616449,NEETenshi,22,swords are very common
559002005516058639,NEETenshi,39,well ye at this point you might as well
559002027456462848,NEETenshi,17,but in the future
559002065628823572,Milim Nava,2,ik
559002091880972299,Milim Nava,35,im never doing another up to step 2
559002165050343434,Milim Nava,84,{im only doing it for this one cuz it has all the types i have aka earth_water_dark}
559002232570511370,NEETenshi,27,those weapons are very good
559002262274310144,NEETenshi,44,Kirito's sword is the best dark sword so far
559002308630020109,Milim Nava,99,best armor for alc yuuki is the armor u get in that equipment creation right? {the yuuki alc armor}
559002360509104149,Milim Nava,14,i have it R4'd
559002422643785758,NEETenshi,45,best armor for swordcraft yuuki is yuuki's R5
559002451571900420,Milim Nava,3,huh
559002510229110794,NEETenshi,33,it's all there on the site I sent
559002554755842068,Milim Nava,109,welp may aswell use this alc yuuki armor till i get mf ;-; {which will never happen since i cant even get 10}
559002613153005589,NEETenshi,0,
559002673245061133,NEETenshi,36,yeah the ranking armors are all good
559002699685691392,NEETenshi,14,3% dmg on crit
559002740903247882,NEETenshi,84,though depending on your run the older 3% damage on weakpoint armors might be better
559002745173049345,FiveAtOnce,163,<@130708054676209664> its almost been 4 months since last water ranking_ which is 8 rankings_ and theres only 7 elements so im assuming theres going to be one soon
559002784754696206,Milim Nava,46,the eugeo armor at R5 has 3% atk for eugeo ;-;
559002833287118881,NEETenshi,121,<@305454993157128194> don't assume anything_ we had the first ever wind ranking since 6* came out in September last month
559002888093827083,NEETenshi,62,we've had repeat element rankings before wind ever came around
559002894280687628,FiveAtOnce,23,When did 6* come out..?
559002918322307074,Milim Nava,13,last year...?
559002918636879872,FiveAtOnce,10,Well crap.
559002923749605396,NEETenshi,12,in September
559002928048766977,NEETenshi,3,lul
559002959791521802,NEETenshi,23,I said it in my message
559002978305179649,FiveAtOnce,5,Oh mb
559003051596316672,Milim Nava,55,marethyu the eugeo armor has 3% atk on R5 for eugeo ;-;
559003066171523084,FiveAtOnce,35,Ooooh i read it wrong_ i get it now
559003086539063308,NEETenshi,46,also the previous wind ranking was last summer
559003091803045891,NEETenshi,4,lulz
559003133032923137,FiveAtOnce,18,Well crahhhhhppppp
559003139441819649,NEETenshi,19,that was 5* era tho
559003176884502548,FiveAtOnce,25,I wants me some water hcs
559003216952426498,NEETenshi,94,<@340138975924715520> all R5 armors have a base ATK value and then 3/2% buff for certain units
559003289270878208,NEETenshi,106,Argo's armor is usually recommended as first armor because it has the highest base attack and it is unisex
559003346317475850,NEETenshi,56,the rest of the armors are locked to their units' gender
559003436386091040,NEETenshi,80,<@305454993157128194> we might get a rainbow banner with a water unit (or units)
559003544762712074,FiveAtOnce,83,If we do_ do you think that the other elements hcs can be exchanged for water ones?
559003564387598366,NEETenshi,3,yes
559003593047408640,NEETenshi,45,that's always been the case since 6* came out
559003602102910994,FiveAtOnce,32,Ooh okie thats fine with me then
559003609971556372,NEETenshi,29,only exception was SKS banner
559003630833893376,FiveAtOnce,6,Sks..?
559003649045430272,NEETenshi,9,Sankishin
559003670679912449,NEETenshi,36,the goddess banner we got in January
559003740422537217,FiveAtOnce,47,And.. wasnt the the most recent rainbow banner?
559003758743257088,NEETenshi,62,Also keep in mind only 200 HC of another element can be traded
559003796097990656,FiveAtOnce,5,That*
559003818080206859,NEETenshi,74,no_ the most recent rainbow banner is the currently-ongoing Rain/Sinon one
559003833263456276,NEETenshi,32,and we can trade HCs on that one
559003855023767554,FiveAtOnce,7,Ah okie
559003871771361300,FiveAtOnce,7,Thanks!
559003882123165697,NEETenshi,99,I think they didn't let us trade on SKS since 2/3 elements were repeats from January's first banner
559003885268631603,Milim Nava,98,;-; hermit coat only give 2% atk to SAO chars {but its recommended that eugeo and alice have it..}
559003909293735947,FiveAtOnce,2,Ah
559003948489506828,NEETenshi,53,the % attack bonus is not as important as base attack
559003964595634176,Milim Nava,3,huh
559004002423930901,Milim Nava,43,interesting <:AliceSmug:499408164177838091>
559004014071644165,NEETenshi,24,just do some quick maffs
559004062906056724,NEETenshi,26,3% of 8k attack is 240 atk
559004105323053067,NEETenshi,36,base attack on most armors is 400ish
559004146368512025,Milim Nava,69,so out of eugeo_alice_yuuki in my team my yuuki would get the most..?
559004219235893269,Milim Nava,31,since the 3% plus the atk boost
559004222855708692,NEETenshi,48,also base attack gets attack buffs applied to it
559004269907279873,NEETenshi,65,whereas the atk boost is only additively added to the other buffs
559004288182124556,Milim Nava,3,huh
559004333056983080,NEETenshi,30,basically base stats > % buffs
559004406184673280,Milim Nava,88,welp thanks for the info now time to cry myself to sleep while tryin to get just 1 mf XD
559004406880927765,NEETenshi,71,if you can get a unit to match like Yuuki with Yuuki armor_ then better
559004411188215811,AceTemper,30,Just quick summarized overview
559004421632163841,NEETenshi,28,but it's not super important
