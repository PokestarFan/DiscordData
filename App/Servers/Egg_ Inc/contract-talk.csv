558430723418357800,McMaster2017,113,Why can¬¥t I acess the contracts page?NLIt says that "Due to local laws you cannot acess to the contracts features"
558432938912382987,lamCube,101,Either you are younger than 16_ or in your country/state some implications of contracts are forbidden
558433027596877825,lamCube,7,or both
558433048555814923,McMaster2017,38,well i'm 16 and my brother could do it
558434203705016322,Elessar,142,you should be able to re-install the game to get the question again. just make sure you have an up to date cloud back up before you delete it.
558435338452729856,McMaster2017,42,If i save it on google plays eill it save?
558435392378896385,McMaster2017,28,Because last time it dis not
558435418077528084,McMaster2017,4,Did*
558435529557934120,hatsune miku,28,How to make it force backup?
558435591260471297,Elessar,114,check in the apps settings.  hit more where it says privacy and data. It will tell you when your last back up was.
558435622415630386,hatsune miku,17,Or force download
558435661875773461,Elessar,51,Neko - Switching eggs or farms will force an update
558435725503103027,hatsune miku,3,Oh?
558435824719626241,Elessar,149,forcing a download I have only been able to do by reinstalling the game (one direction works fine_ going back the other way takes a reinstall for me)
558435916692193280,hatsune miku,2,Ic
558436033457291295,hatsune miku,37,Troublesome to switch between device.
558436159030820865,McMaster2017,30,Ok i am about to re install it
558436362953424941,hatsune miku,54,I try clear cach and data to force download. It works.
558436565198700556,hatsune miku,41,How to switch farm when there no contract
558437396010500109,lamCube,245,To trigger a backup you just need to do some meaningful action changing your farm state_ like buying something_ or hitting a few drones_ or toggling some configuration. Visit the privacy & data page until you see a backup in the last few seconds
558437440457801748,lamCube,37,being connected to the Internet helps
558437463899635772,McMaster2017,44,Thank youso much_ i can now do thr contracts
558443312999301121,Elessar,149,It backs up periodically on its own_ but switching eggs or farms (only if you have a contract) is the only thing I‚Äôve seen that forces it right then.
558993693982588928,J4YTH3L3G3ND,30,When is the next coop contract
558995551228657675,Toxoplasmolly,13,No one knows.
558996960493961246,Dyasher,239,I have a contract question. Based on my egg per second rate right now_ if I multiply it by 3600 and then again by the number of hours I have left in my contract_ it should give me a rough estimate of how many more eggs I should lay_ right?
558997007893528576,Dyasher,0,
559002001418223646,Dyasher,57,Okay cool_ this should be my first solo I finish for a pe
559002155327946809,Dyasher,67,Just had a nice delivery of 26M chicks so it bumped me up to 4.8B/s
559008133083693076,Emporium,150,Yeah. you should deliver ~552T more eggs by the time your contract is over based on that laying rate.  Congrats on your first completed solo contract!
559011016982134804,Dyasher,8,Thanks üòÅ
559060286321983508,Quail,84,<#455388192674283521> is a nice channel for goofing around with the haiku recognizer
559060378407927809,Sami,47,Ok.  Sorry the first on was contract related :)
560285887926239237,lamCube,28,Found it. Really forgettable
560286845288579073,lamCube,17,Different prizes?
560287109861081118,IdahoTBone,41,I think same rewards_ but upgraded goals.
560287719155171339,lamCube,58,Second was +2 transportations. I see it's transportations.
560287921668751391,lamCube,105,First was +10000GE_ but I can't remember if the piggy+ is leveling or additional GE. Tomorrow we will see
560288240905617410,lamCube,50,So they were both late August_ graviton and fusion
560288475371536435,lamCube,25,Ok_ let's bite the bullet
560600327670333445,Dyasher,48,Force quit the app and restart your phone maybe?
560602702284062721,norsekidoutofframe,95,well at this point i just restarted the contracts but if it happens again ill reinstall the app
560624697130221568,·¥∏·¥∞·¥ø‡¶ä«æo‚Ñ±‚Ñ†,42,Anyone want to help me in fusion contract?
560624962067759105,Quail,129,<@453725117004906496> That message is a form of recruiting_ which we don't allow outside <#455385719301472286>. Please be patient
560625000487321651,·¥∏·¥∞·¥ø‡¶ä«æo‚Ñ±‚Ñ†,13,Ok I am sorry
560625029742723072,·¥∏·¥∞·¥ø‡¶ä«æo‚Ñ±‚Ñ†,19,I am kinda new here
560625332667809801,Quail,125,Have a read through our various information channels_ <#455396915731890177> <#455385905499340813>_ and watch how we do things
560631241259614228,Evan Yoohoo,13,YOOOOO üò†üò†üò°üò†üò°üò†
560631266387689472,Evan Yoohoo,2,üò°üò†
560632358253101087,Evan Yoohoo,141,What are these "legacy contracts to try again"?NLAss soon as I opened them I had all rewards but last.NLBut I know I didn't miss any contracts.
560632425907224606,Evan Yoohoo,55,Am I getting a second helping of golden eggs from them?
560632963528785941,aggiemd91,18,!?react readevents
560633133431521281,Quail,262,The final goal total has been increased on three of the legacy contracts. When you "restart" them_ the game checks whether you met the goals_ and sees that you did not. Your PE is taken away. It is given back when you complete the updated version of the contract
560633342349803520,lamCube,2,Ot
560633349610274836,Quail,257,So it is up to each player to keep track of which contracts they have completed_ and to be vigilant when contracts are released. We will document re-releases_ and the push notifications the dev sends inform which ones are legacies_ but each player must read
560638266840449024,WaringMcMarrin,57,they also say restart if you have done them before right?
560639386862223362,Emporium,3,Yes
560639504751394816,lamCube,40,If you have 55 PE_ you already did them.
560639582610128905,lamCube,57,Probably if you have more than 40 PE you already did them
560640137453764629,lamCube,48,19 PE were given in contracts before those ones.
560640414617436162,lamCube,66,People missing PEs probably miss the ones from the early contracts
560640841144729631,lamCube,117,If you were not able to play those weeks_ probably you did not even start the contracts and they would be new for you
560641200378347562,lamCube,69,Wrong count: probably 21 PE were distributed before those contracts üòÉ
560651060142931990,Oliver,74,Is the top player glitching? I don‚Äôt think we should‚Äôve finished this fast
560651201931378699,Emporium,46,Yeah...that's a textbook example of a glitcher
560651450674446358,AndyVshr,23,There's a textbook now?
560651900509356062,Oliver,33,I feel bad that I got the rewards
560652332811943966,AndyVshr,75,The name doesn't match anyone here. If anyone knows who it is_ just say so.
560948199741718548,MrMotoGamez,29,how does that command work???
560976727682318358,Almo,57,The graviton coop isn‚Äôt as hard as the diaper one_ is it?
560977298006736904,Quail,113,The graviton egg has a higher value than the quantum egg_ which makes it easier to afford habs/transport/research
