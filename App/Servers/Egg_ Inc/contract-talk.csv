558432938912382987,lamCube,101,Either you are younger than 16_ or in your country/state some implications of contracts are forbidden
558433027596877825,lamCube,7,or both
558433048555814923,McMaster2017,38,well i'm 16 and my brother could do it
558434203705016322,Elessar,142,you should be able to re-install the game to get the question again. just make sure you have an up to date cloud back up before you delete it.

558435529557934120,hatsune miku,28,How to make it force backup?
558435591260471297,Elessar,114,check in the apps settings.  hit more where it says privacy and data. It will tell you when your last back up was.
558435622415630386,hatsune miku,17,Or force download
558435661875773461,Elessar,51,Neko - Switching eggs or farms will force an update
558435725503103027,hatsune miku,3,Oh?
558435824719626241,Elessar,149,forcing a download I have only been able to do by reinstalling the game (one direction works fine_ going back the other way takes a reinstall for me)

558436033457291295,hatsune miku,37,Troublesome to switch between device.

558436565198700556,hatsune miku,41,How to switch farm when there no contract
558437396010500109,lamCube,245,To trigger a backup you just need to do some meaningful action changing your farm state_ like buying something_ or hitting a few drones_ or toggling some configuration. Visit the privacy & data page until you see a backup in the last few seconds
558437440457801748,lamCube,37,being connected to the Internet helps
558437463899635772,McMaster2017,44,Thank youso much_ i can now do thr contracts
558443312999301121,Elessar,149,It backs up periodically on its own_ but switching eggs or farms (only if you have a contract) is the only thing I’ve seen that forces it right then.
