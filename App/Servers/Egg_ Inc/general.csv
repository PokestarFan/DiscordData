559002332575301658,Charlesberg,76,Anyone help what's the recommend amount of SE to compete edible egg trophies
559004689060986901,Elessar,80,Charles berg there is a chart of recommended EBs pinned in <#455385659079917569>
559004971589304320,hatsune miku,38,Half way to 1B edible. Damn lengthy...

559006942450941962,hatsune miku,33,Maybe I should do this at 2B% EB.

559065369663242267,WaringMcMarrin,21,how many SE you have?
559065457857003550,TwitchDagelijks,7,2414907
559065658307117086,TwitchDagelijks,8,and 5 PE
559065804558303242,WaringMcMarrin,190,So the trophy would just over double your SE count. Have to decide if that is worth spending GE on though if you don't have a good amount in the extended warping research it is not worth it.
559076932365582346,Elessar,140,there isn't one based on a percentage or a number. the percentage will keep getting smaller_ the number bigger_ the more often you prestige.
559077384733851660,* Ilmeme,21,What's a 10% pick up?
559077679085912067,chadgetsbored,156,At nebula.   Certainly accumulate fastest here.   Even though it is fastest seems like at some point makes sense to purge.   And quickly get back to nebula.
559078032057565194,chadgetsbored,83,<@406495391367036929> was just saying accumulat 10 percent of total before prestige
559078086067355678,Elessar,167,some people like to prestige at a lower population_ once the SE gains start to slow (somewhere between 800m and 1.2b seem to be most common_ though I have seen lower).
559078317995851778,Elessar,194,I have tried that (and many_ many other tests) several times. I absolutely get more SE quicker by filling the habs. But everyones device/play style combination creates different results_ so ymmv
559088935352139786,Dyasher,27,Swipe you finger for drones
559088948442562591,Dyasher,9,Don‚Äôt tap
559089170887213081,amorfati,18,how does that help
559089197756186624,Quail,111,Try planting your finger ahead of the path of the drone_ and the little fella will fly right into you. Crash! üí•
559089291221794876,amorfati,10,oh_ thanks
559089318048563200,Dyasher,90,You don‚Äôt need to tap on them_ basically you can do a small swipe in front like Quail said
559089395500711965,Dyasher,50,This was a nice surprise when I learned this too üòÉ
559089481802711041,Elessar,128,swiping for the drones gives a bunch of intersection points possible for the drone_ plus swiping won't open any of the buildings
559089630033608709,Elessar,72,that plus Farm to Table was my salvation until i "gotgud" at drone hunts
559089925543165961,Quail,151,For all the "don't tap" advice that folks give_ it really does feel satisfying to tap an elite drone out of the air. Just press it right out of the sky
559090411545690124,Elessar,164,completely agree_ Quail_ though i think i personally get more frustrated at tapping an elite and opening the silos instead than i get satisfaction from hitting hit.
559090828581273619,Quail,148,When I first started_ I missed the regular drones so consistently that I thought they weren't actually separate objects. Gave up on them for a while
559094145898119187,amorfati,7,aww yea
