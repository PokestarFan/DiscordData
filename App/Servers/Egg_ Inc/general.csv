559065658307117086,TwitchDagelijks,8,and 5 PE
559065804558303242,WaringMcMarrin,190,So the trophy would just over double your SE count. Have to decide if that is worth spending GE on though if you don't have a good amount in the extended warping research it is not worth it.
559076932365582346,Elessar,140,there isn't one based on a percentage or a number. the percentage will keep getting smaller_ the number bigger_ the more often you prestige.
559077384733851660,* Ilmeme,21,What's a 10% pick up?
559077679085912067,chadgetsbored,156,At nebula.   Certainly accumulate fastest here.   Even though it is fastest seems like at some point makes sense to purge.   And quickly get back to nebula.
559078032057565194,chadgetsbored,83,<@406495391367036929> was just saying accumulat 10 percent of total before prestige
559078086067355678,Elessar,167,some people like to prestige at a lower population_ once the SE gains start to slow (somewhere between 800m and 1.2b seem to be most common_ though I have seen lower).
559078317995851778,Elessar,194,I have tried that (and many_ many other tests) several times. I absolutely get more SE quicker by filling the habs. But everyones device/play style combination creates different results_ so ymmv

559089291221794876,amorfati,10,oh_ thanks
559089318048563200,Dyasher,90,You don‚Äôt need to tap on them_ basically you can do a small swipe in front like Quail said
559089395500711965,Dyasher,50,This was a nice surprise when I learned this too üòÉ
559089481802711041,Elessar,128,swiping for the drones gives a bunch of intersection points possible for the drone_ plus swiping won't open any of the buildings
559089630033608709,Elessar,72,that plus Farm to Table was my salvation until i "gotgud" at drone hunts
559089925543165961,Quail,151,For all the "don't tap" advice that folks give_ it really does feel satisfying to tap an elite drone out of the air. Just press it right out of the sky
559090411545690124,Elessar,164,completely agree_ Quail_ though i think i personally get more frustrated at tapping an elite and opening the silos instead than i get satisfaction from hitting hit.
559090828581273619,Quail,148,When I first started_ I missed the regular drones so consistently that I thought they weren't actually separate objects. Gave up on them for a while
559094145898119187,amorfati,7,aww yea
559095011694870560,WaringMcMarrin,88,amorfati we really don't need a running count of how many chickens you have on your farm

559097088131072011,Elessar,26,lots and lots of prestiges
559097663782518814,Quail,179,One clever secret of the game is_ no matter which egg you're on_ you're actually farming soul eggs. Prestiging is a core mechanic of the game_ and you shouldn't be afraid to do it
559098072169316373,AndyVshr,28,It's a very prestigious game
559098551335125012,WaringMcMarrin,132,currently my game play is prestiging a bunch of times at the edible farm between runs to nebula just to increase my prestige count üòõ
559098858391732265,amorfati,30,i'm letting my phone cool down
559098929443242007,Elessar,158,i have considered doing that. but i am closing in on 1400 anyway_ and i think that only matters if there happens to be some new way of getting way too many pe
559099437046300703,amorfati,25,cookie clicker came first
559099443652198428,amorfati,16,what a gold game
559099688884895744,Elessar,123,this is the first incremental game i played. i had no idea what this was until i played it for a while. (i came for the AR)
559099721981886465,WaringMcMarrin,94,yah that is the only time it matters but since I am currently at 100 I could stand to get more

559099904698613772,Elessar,119,^ that (called Farm to Table in this game_ and I believe its only ios still_ despite what it says in android app store)
559107361927594040,Quail,17,I agree with that
559111908117053497,amorfati,14,i have no life
560286784161054722,Dyasher,78,What happens if you restart but don‚Äôt hit the PE goal_ would you lose the egg?
560286966805954581,Elessar,39,prolly_ but i am not testing that one üòÉ
560287003845853196,Dyasher,9,Lol yikes
560287139489906728,lamCube,41,The prizes for Habitapull seem different.
560287433397239828,lamCube,84,No_ probably the same. Can't remember if the piggy+ is piggy level or piggy increase
560287706840694817,Quail,56,Piggy+ is plus one level. Piggyx is a content multiplier
560624273224630282,cantpunishme,62,even if a non-PE goal were raised_ i don't think you'd lose it
560624364039438369,hatsune miku,23,What statement is that?
560624376471355429,cantpunishme,88,because PE are the only thing that is counted by inspecting contract completion... afaik
560624484210573312,hatsune miku,36,So cheaters are not welcome in game?
560624520906407936,hatsune miku,12,Coz pe lost?
560624573645848576,cantpunishme,16,cheating is fine
560624590036926538,cantpunishme,18,just not in a coop
560624609196507137,cantpunishme,41,unless the coop has explicitly allowed it
560624697704710146,hatsune miku,49,That doesn't mean anyone will lost pe due to that
560624786837864469,cantpunishme,43,oh_ referring to lamCube's comment. no idea
560625086487330816,Elessar,64,jump to the most recent pin_ the story happened right before it.
560625232348577802,Elessar,141,tl:dr person glitched a re-contract so quickly they didn't lose the PE until after they finished_ so the appear to have permanently lost a pe
560625290888347679,cantpunishme,10,haha_ nice
560625341312401420,cantpunishme,33,i could probably help them fix it

560625591062102041,cantpunishme,89,based on my understanding of the game i'm not entirely sure why that would happen_ though
560625614726627358,cantpunishme,7,ah well
560625646754332672,hatsune miku,38,<:GWahreeVampySmug:369468206735425546>
560625674877009930,cantpunishme,72,i mean_ it seems to me like they'd be able to restart the contract again
560625712453779457,Elessar,57,(entirely possible the details were_ uh_ wrong_ lets say)
560625713250828292,cantpunishme,61,if it got saved incorrectly in such a way that the PE is lost
560625763766763520,cantpunishme,6,Indeed
560626585443631104,lamCube,272,I was referring to the fact that_ as far as I recall_  the dynamic balance check of PEs was added to the game because cheaters where multiplying PEs_ so that the developer had to introduce the sanity check that the number of PE was to be derived by the completed contracts
560626732932136961,lamCube,52,So_ now_ when contracts change_ the PE number change
560626816444923944,cantpunishme,99,yes_ the check is basically .... for (c in completed_contracts) { if (c.laid > c.goal) pe += c.pe }
560626823139164160,lamCube,41,Perhaps_ if people were not abusing it...
560626939573043220,cantpunishme,76,it's not clear to me why completing it "too fast" would go around that logic
560626958476640293,cantpunishme,37,we'd need to look at the guy's backup
560627000591777814,Lordfreya,70,If I have 55 PE_ that means I completed all legacy contracts_ correct?
560627016970403871,cantpunishme,3,yes
560627017289170955,lamCube,52,it's not c.laid_ otherwise you cannot complete coops
560627036029321216,Lordfreya,44,Don‚Äôt want to restart an old one for nothing
560627048826011678,cantpunishme,4,sure

560628449736392725,lamCube,234,About the lost PE of the "glitcher"_ I think it's possible that by changing the time_ that person finished in a state in which the contract was expired but the goal was not reached. So the contract registered as completed_ and failed.
560628708407246875,Quail,104,I still think the problem is that he completed the contract before the game registered the PE withdrawal

560631491114041364,hatsune miku,37,Oh right. That would make some sense.
560632721618239508,lamCube,79,The 2PE->1PE contract was the one at the end of December. These were iin August

560633695694880789,Quail,207,It's the best answer I can come up with for there being an extra PE to take away. Like the game has found a way to correct this error - though so far PE removal only corresponds to specific contracts etc etc
