558767845278744576,Eave,195,Yea i figured itâ€™d be nice for coops further along the way but I understand the concerns. The way e!coop is presented now makes it really hard to read. Can the spacing be fixed? Thank you so much
558768599578181644,Toxoplasmolly,117,`e!coop` looks fine to me_ both on my phone and on my laptop. Is there something specific that you find hard to read?
558769047785963551,Tiln,37,I recent made the spacing *very* nice
558769104975167489,lamCube,86,Considering that it was recently changed to make it more compact and less space hogger
558769409225785344,lamCube,97,I preferred the rate in parenthesis_ more separated from the egg value_ but it's ok also this way
558769529619087370,Tiln,44,Seggested one way_ counter suggested back_ ðŸ¤·
558769642043342868,lamCube,84,In fact I not complained (at least as far as I can remember) when you did the change
558769742903509012,lamCube,38,all the others were a huge improvement
558770072886181888,Tiln,21,you "not complained"?
558777758290018326,Tiln,5,These
558778325804253227,lamCube,52,is there a logic in the different colors for players
558778444482347040,Tiln,59,There is logic to the colors_ but I can't control it at all
558778582030221339,lamCube,49,I refer to swift_ where there is a mixed coloring
558778720584728586,Tiln,42,it's only orange because of Capitalizaiton
558778784527024139,lamCube,128,I understand coloring either [ ]  or the unknowns_ but the mixed coloring is nice looking but... THEY will ask you the rationale
558778800016719912,lamCube,16,and the numbers?
558778890235936809,Tiln,8,just is?
558779526511984699,lamCube,108,bah. perhaps ini_ that is like it is now_ with the  [ ] colored... I do not think we need color in the text.
558779637686206484,lamCube,95,The others are just a shift in the color palette_ but the effect might depend on the user theme
558779743000854528,lamCube,30,better not to mess with themes
558779938757672970,Tiln,43,none of the colors show up on mobile_ afaik
558780514740207645,lamCube,138,I use the dark theme on the computer. Now I switched on light_ and I'm blinded ðŸ˜ƒ I do not know how good would be orange or green on white.
558780584059731998,lamCube,18,if they stay fixed
558780926662803477,Tiln,62,try them yourself on lightd_ thenNL\`\`\`swiftNLtextNLtextNL\`\`\`
558785872523296769,lamCube,22,```swiftNLtextNLtextNL```
558786037682274306,lamCube,27,```cssNLtextNLtext saaaaaNL```
558786096805183489,lamCube,16,css is ... green
558786208365543445,lamCube,25,```yamlNLtext for yamlNL```
558786337428471809,lamCube,23,```fixNLtext for fixNL```
558786452222378014,lamCube,51,They are ok_ probably already toned for both themes
558788198122258452,lamCube,65,You could A/B activate yaml or fix_ and see the people reaction ðŸ˜ƒ
