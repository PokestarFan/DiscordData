558862620476833792,ThereIsNoBall,126,Too early to tell. Rassele could have just Wikipedia’d all that. Here’s the true test: Did you enjoy reading The Silmarillion?
558862903579639818,Elessar,195,never made it through. tried three different times. i LOVE the Lord of the Rings. the rest of Tolkien isn't great. The Hobbit is one of the best children's books ever_ but it is a children's book
558863164943368192,ThereIsNoBall,88,You passed the test. Any other answer would have told us you were a faker or casual fan.
558863258640056322,ThereIsNoBall,48,Especially “yes”. Then we’d know you were lying.
