560621981427564569,r/teenagers,serious-personal,327,Yeah I know I debated that in <#278625925170462720> the other day.  Most people say they'll be hero's but won't be.  I however will be because I already wanna die so it's like no loss to me.  And if I win I'll save someone's life which will give me a cool ego boost and hide the depression for a few days  <@365323228530343940>
