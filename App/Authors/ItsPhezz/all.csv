560621981427564569,r/teenagers,serious-personal,327,Yeah I know I debated that in <#278625925170462720> the other day.  Most people say they'll be hero's but won't be.  I however will be because I already wanna die so it's like no loss to me.  And if I win I'll save someone's life which will give me a cool ego boost and hide the depression for a few days  <@365323228530343940>

Depression is permanent.  it's not going away_ i'm always gonna want to die on some level.  Plus when you reach my level where your so desperate for friendship and attention that you basically obsess over it everytime you don't have it you feel so hopeless.NLNLI hate being by myself_ i hate sitting in my room being alone.  i wanna talk to people and hangout and leave the house but i can't
