Explore your interests_ seek new things_ new people and this summer is a great place to start. Meetup.com or maybe just hang out with friends.
558784931577331724,99,But no matter what there are always people who value you and care about your feelings and interests
558785349279547402,282,I know what it’s like to shut out from others_ I’ve had times where I was in bed crying my eyes out and not moving unless to eat or shower and stuff and I didn’t talk to a soul. But I found out at least for myself I was happiest when I explored my interests and hung out with people
558785473284407326,93,Now I get it_ I’m introverted_ people aren’t my thing_ I’m not the best at that kind of stuff
558785536962330655,51,But close friends make such a difference in my life
558786471398473748,222,<@!371772127117967361> take time to explore_ it’s all about what you like. The good part is no one is there to judge your thoughts and you can take things step by step and on your own terms. Like I said meetup.com is great
558786616554946590,102,Maybe if you like a certain sport you can find others to play or if you like games you can pursue that
558786795660116008,112,Maybe you’d like D&D. I urge you to find a dungeons and dragons group. If you like that kind of stuff of course.
558786910185586699,133,It’s helped me meet new friends and create lasting relationships with others because of the bond we’ve had roleplaying and having fun
558787472641884182,37,You could always start your own 🤷🏻‍♂️
558787613620961281,54,There are a lot of people who play_ are you in France?
558787790834499624,40,I know it’s popular among American teens
558787853308395520,38,But I’m sure in Paris you’ll find some
558787936938622977,76,Just wasn’t sure if you lived on like a dairy farm in the French countryside
559089010232918016,61,<@256144552052654080> how long ago did she break up with you?
559089522508431360,304,Oh darn. Yeah that is very very soon. Well it’s important to think about what *you* want in this situation. If you think that she’d take you back maybe you guys can work something out. But if it just wasn’t working out or there is little holding it all up_ it might be best to let things live in the past
559089809864392714,259,But it’s important to develop yourself as a better person. Try not to let things bring you down. Summer is almost here and you’ll be able to do so much_ you’ll find your happiness. It is hard I know_ but you’ll be happy without her I promise_ it’ll get better
559090197120286721,182,Explore your interests_ find a new hobby_ find a job_ spend time with friends_ exercise_ grab some buddies and play badminton or something lol. You’ll make it through I promise. 😃 ❤️
559090614717906954,86,In the words of the hype beasts. “Don’t let these thots bring you off that grind 👏😫💪🏆”
