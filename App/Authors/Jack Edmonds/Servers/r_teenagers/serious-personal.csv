558777858651193364,93,Yep. That's what I try. But buying that train ticket_ I had my mood ruined. Like_ completely.
558778014020927499,76,My parents have fuck all money. Even then_ it's not like they'd give me some

558791781697716235,65,Okay. This is a little extreme. But you could offer an ultimatum.
558791989282209802,166,Just tell him that you're going to do what you want_ and if he refuses_ just leave. If you have somewhere to go_ go there. If not_ just spend a few hours to yourself.
558792394783326228,90,Same. I just feel exhausted from existing. My mind_ body and soul is damaged beyond belief
