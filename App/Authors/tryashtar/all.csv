559110043526627356,MINECRAFT,technical-java,41,It just adds that tag to pufferfish items
559110167401332746,MINECRAFT,technical-java,31,If you changed it correctly yes
559110198547972106,MINECRAFT,technical-java,26,Throwing with right-click?
559110222300446735,MINECRAFT,technical-java,2,No
559110245192826890,MINECRAFT,technical-java,30,What tag are you doing anyhow?
559110392874401832,MINECRAFT,technical-java,70,Then can't you just doNL`execute at @e[type=snowball] run summon arrow`

559110856353251330,MINECRAFT,technical-java,32,In some cases that's fine though
559110991468560545,MINECRAFT,technical-java,91,Yeah_ the NBT will stay as an item_ but not transfer to the snowball entity to my knowledge
