558797808052862997,debates,23,Fuck Robert Mueller btw
558798170419757056,debates,118,Bodily sovereignty applies to death. If we have the right to live_ we have the right to die at any time for any reason
558798383024832513,debates,216,In order for full bodily autonomy to exist we cannot stop somebody from committing suicide unless we're willing to say that you do *not* have the right to bodily autonomy_ which is a very scary precedent in any case.
558798494031413258,debates,4,Nope
558798546267144192,debates,28,100% bodily autonomy or none
558798615477485579,debates,55,Dr. Kevorkian was correct in every single thing he did.
558798684205350923,debates,46,He was a doctor who performed assisted suicide
558798706191630337,debates,16,Convicted for it
558799004188672002,debates,284,Ok if we're gonna stop someone from dying. How about this?NLNLYou're mentally unstable_ you can't drive a car.NLNLYou're mentally unstable_ you can't hold silverware.NLNLYou're mentally unstable_ you can't reproduce. NLNLYou're mentally unstable_ you can't work.NLNLSee the precedent this sets?
558799068122578945,debates,34,I hate that temporary problem line
558799094831775745,debates,43,Because a lot of problems are not temporary
558799151924510731,debates,97,And you have no right to judge whether it is or isn't temporary_ nor does the fucking government.
558799287471964202,debates,148,The precedent is that if we do not have bodily autonomy in cases of suicide_ then we also don't have it in any case where we can endanger ourselves.
558799368656912396,debates,4,Yeah
558799638057058335,debates,305,How about this person is irresponsible_ we don't like their life choices. So let's say they can only work a certain job_ only live in a certain place_ only talk to certain people_ and only eat certain things. All for *their benefit*. They're not able to make their own choices_ they might hurt themselves.
558799796735836168,debates,4,Nope
558799834883293186,debates,54,It's the logical scenario to removing bodily autonomy.
558799903665422347,debates,107,It is the logical conclusion once you say that someone doesn't have the right to own or control their body.
558799967985205283,debates,31,Yes it is <@325739257622691841>
558799992815353876,debates,22,It's literally a crime
558799996598616081,debates,3,Yes

558800949657731072,debates,4,Nope
558801063227162625,debates,39,Yes I am talking about assisted suicide
558801120076627989,debates,14,It was implied
558801143812063232,debates,24,It was very much implied
558801159415005194,debates,21,You're bad at reading
558801317070635038,debates,43,The conversation is around assisted suicide
558801334573465600,debates,14,Try to keep up
558801462730162221,debates,148,Anyway as far as 2020 it depends who the Democrats nominate. If it's an absolute corporate shill or uncharismatic husk like O'Rourke it'll be Trump.
558801558247047208,debates,3,Yes
558801571673276422,debates,16,The conversation
558801587204521984,debates,25,Is about assisted suicide
558801671631929364,debates,24,And I was proven correct
558801726422122496,debates,9,Yes I did
558801749989785630,debates,39,The conversation is on assisted suicide
558801810693947415,debates,38,You people really cannot connect A+B=C
558801867077845054,debates,52,The context of this part was around assisted suicide
558801883297218562,debates,25,I'm being perfectly civil
558801964197216258,debates,47,And the conversation is on **assisted suicide**
558802017334722561,debates,46,I proved that **assisted suicide is *illegal**
558802094535213076,debates,65,Yes and the context of their conversation was on assisted suicide
558802227389530115,debates,72,Private school is shit also because they're a lot of times not regulated
558802298671726602,debates,99,My sister went to a private school where they didn't have fucking licensed teachers teaching there.
558802397372219402,debates,52,Also private school kids are almost always dickheads
558802480926818324,debates,25,Yes it's a generalization
558802641614798849,debates,50,The GND isn't legislation as a lot of people think
558802654038327327,debates,19,It's a set of goals
558802699827806228,debates,35,Not all of the goals need to be met
558802733767983105,debates,34,But it's a nonbinding set of goals
558802765913128970,debates,39,The world **is** on the brink of ending

558803184408199198,debates,2,No
558803214204665857,debates,38,It's that we have 12 years to avert it
558803229056696362,debates,15,As a collective
558803359616860171,debates,75,12 years is the breaking point for  the effects being close to irreversible
558803442051842060,debates,34,You're a fucking piece of shit wow

558804337271373844,debates,117,Ethnostates necessitate the violent removal of a certain ethnicity because there is no state purely of one ethnicity.
558804409480642570,debates,17,Yes they're awful
558804464358653952,debates,38,They're run by neo-fascist governments

558806773096644618,debates,16,Read the article
558807040147980291,debates,145,Ok so fascism is basically far right authoritarian hypernationalism which places emphasis usually on race and scapegoats immigrants and the left.

558807544378687500,debates,83,These people do not realize that "far right hyper nationalism" is pretty fascistic.

558808515087564810,debates,77,Hitler hadn't killed his opposition in 1933. It's called consolidating power.
558808528056483860,debates,17,And it takes time

558808817505271809,debates,8,Whatever
558808937814687764,debates,56,As I said you don't understand what *rising fascism* is.
558808961696923661,debates,32,Which makes this pointless to do
558809301783937054,debates,193,Rising fascism is usually characterized by a destruction of democratic institutions_ and a rise in hypernationalistic rhetoric_ as well as the scapegoating of a group or groups (I.E immigrants)

The tribunal is still in place_ but its independence and legitimacy have been seriously undermined.NLNL“I call on all political forces to engage in good faith in a constructive dialogue aimed at restoring the authority of the tribunal and its role as guarantor of the supremacy of the constitution.”NLNLThe Supreme Court was also at risk of being undermined_ the Special Rapporteur said. Reforms currently under way would potentially weaken its independence and capacity to ensure checks and balances_ and to protect and promote human rights_ he noted in a statement at the end of his mission.
558810098873532426,debates,26,Well here's how I see that
558810366134452224,debates,216,The judicial indepdence of a nation affects very very much how a other institutions like the legislative function. So maybe this one doesn't destroy the judiciary_ but it's opening the door to consolidation of power.

558842312579612704,debates,134,They've been pretending to while continuing the wholescale slaughter in Yemen and prosecuting women who campaigned for driving rights.
558842331239809024,debates,19,It's a P.R campaign
558843225226477588,debates,30,That's a severe understatement
558843237947670548,debates,15,It's a genocide
