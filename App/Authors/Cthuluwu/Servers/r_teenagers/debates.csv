558797808052862997,23,Fuck Robert Mueller btw
558798170419757056,118,Bodily sovereignty applies to death. If we have the right to live_ we have the right to die at any time for any reason
558798383024832513,216,In order for full bodily autonomy to exist we cannot stop somebody from committing suicide unless we're willing to say that you do *not* have the right to bodily autonomy_ which is a very scary precedent in any case.
558798494031413258,4,Nope
558798546267144192,28,100% bodily autonomy or none
558798615477485579,55,Dr. Kevorkian was correct in every single thing he did.
558798684205350923,46,He was a doctor who performed assisted suicide
558798706191630337,16,Convicted for it
558799004188672002,284,Ok if we're gonna stop someone from dying. How about this?NLNLYou're mentally unstable_ you can't drive a car.NLNLYou're mentally unstable_ you can't hold silverware.NLNLYou're mentally unstable_ you can't reproduce. NLNLYou're mentally unstable_ you can't work.NLNLSee the precedent this sets?
558799068122578945,34,I hate that temporary problem line
558799094831775745,43,Because a lot of problems are not temporary
558799151924510731,97,And you have no right to judge whether it is or isn't temporary_ nor does the fucking government.
558799287471964202,148,The precedent is that if we do not have bodily autonomy in cases of suicide_ then we also don't have it in any case where we can endanger ourselves.
558799368656912396,4,Yeah
558799638057058335,305,How about this person is irresponsible_ we don't like their life choices. So let's say they can only work a certain job_ only live in a certain place_ only talk to certain people_ and only eat certain things. All for *their benefit*. They're not able to make their own choices_ they might hurt themselves.
558799796735836168,4,Nope
558799834883293186,54,It's the logical scenario to removing bodily autonomy.
558799903665422347,107,It is the logical conclusion once you say that someone doesn't have the right to own or control their body.
558799967985205283,31,Yes it is <@325739257622691841>
558799992815353876,22,It's literally a crime
558799996598616081,3,Yes
558800001187446827,5,It is
558800068178608129,12,Sure hang on
558800359150190624,0,
558800414988959785,2,Us
558800441639567366,9,Yes it is
558800708275535883,19,Yeah it's Wikipedia

558800949657731072,4,Nope
558801063227162625,39,Yes I am talking about assisted suicide
558801120076627989,14,It was implied
558801143812063232,24,It was very much implied
558801159415005194,21,You're bad at reading
558801317070635038,43,The conversation is around assisted suicide
558801334573465600,14,Try to keep up
558801462730162221,148,Anyway as far as 2020 it depends who the Democrats nominate. If it's an absolute corporate shill or uncharismatic husk like O'Rourke it'll be Trump.
558801558247047208,3,Yes
558801571673276422,16,The conversation
558801587204521984,25,Is about assisted suicide
558801671631929364,24,And I was proven correct
558801726422122496,9,Yes I did
558801749989785630,39,The conversation is on assisted suicide
558801810693947415,38,You people really cannot connect A+B=C
558801867077845054,52,The context of this part was around assisted suicide
558801883297218562,25,I'm being perfectly civil
558801964197216258,47,And the conversation is on **assisted suicide**
558802017334722561,46,I proved that **assisted suicide is *illegal**
558802094535213076,65,Yes and the context of their conversation was on assisted suicide
558802227389530115,72,Private school is shit also because they're a lot of times not regulated
558802298671726602,99,My sister went to a private school where they didn't have fucking licensed teachers teaching there.
558802397372219402,52,Also private school kids are almost always dickheads
558802480926818324,25,Yes it's a generalization
558802641614798849,50,The GND isn't legislation as a lot of people think
558802654038327327,19,It's a set of goals
558802699827806228,35,Not all of the goals need to be met
558802733767983105,34,But it's a nonbinding set of goals
558802765913128970,39,The world **is** on the brink of ending
558802780857303042,8,12 years
558802804953579541,3,Yes
558802817939406888,17,That's a UN study

558803015092535312,3,Yes
558803031173365778,27,And this is the proof of it
558803115525013507,57,Parts of the world will be sumberged literally underwater
558803165567385610,25,Island nations are fucked
558803184408199198,2,No
558803214204665857,38,It's that we have 12 years to avert it
558803229056696362,15,As a collective
558803359616860171,75,12 years is the breaking point for  the effects being close to irreversible
558803442051842060,34,You're a fucking piece of shit wow

558803544023760897,29,You sound like a fucking Nazi
558803598784331786,7,He said
558803619567239169,37,Inferior countries would be destroyed
558803697019125780,52,I guess he believes he's the ubermensch or something
558803795245662232,21,I'm blocking him yeah
558803995804696595,32,Ethnostates are not maintainable
558804061277913099,29,So here's the thing with race
558804209080991745,61,A band-aid on the bigger problem or automation and capitalism
558804337271373844,117,Ethnostates necessitate the violent removal of a certain ethnicity because there is no state purely of one ethnicity.
558804409480642570,17,Yes they're awful
558804464358653952,38,They're run by neo-fascist governments

558806757045174283,10,You didn't
558806762711547904,4,Even
558806773096644618,16,Read the article
558807040147980291,145,Ok so fascism is basically far right authoritarian hypernationalism which places emphasis usually on race and scapegoats immigrants and the left.
558807070019682304,11,You realize
558807085245267980,26,That the world nationalist
558807110259965982,30,Doesn't make this  not fascism

558807146007887876,2,No
558807198885609474,3,Yes
558807345866604555,49,Mussolini never took over every sphere of society
558807362337505296,20,Neither did Pinochet
558807378179522591,18,They were fascists
558807409640996864,28,By any reasonable definition
558807544378687500,83,These people do not realize that "far right hyper nationalism" is pretty fascistic.
558807572841365529,3,Yes

558807785157165107,2,No
558807798637658123,18,I certainly do not
558808192780337183,137,You're just taking a dictionary definition_ stripped of all context. What else usually comes with fascism? NLNLRight wing hypernationalism.
558808299957649419,36,Yes and it's present all over Europe
558808327203586099,32,**HE ADDRESSED A FASCIST RALLY**
558808425505488897,70,Does he have to be murdering immigrants with a shovel to be a fascist?
558808515087564810,77,Hitler hadn't killed his opposition in 1933. It's called consolidating power.
558808528056483860,17,And it takes time
558808630229729291,62,It's like you don't understand the concept of *rising fascism*
558808817505271809,8,Whatever
558808937814687764,56,As I said you don't understand what *rising fascism* is.
558808961696923661,32,Which makes this pointless to do
558809301783937054,193,Rising fascism is usually characterized by a destruction of democratic institutions_ and a rise in hypernationalistic rhetoric_ as well as the scapegoating of a group or groups (I.E immigrants)
558809480050245647,48,Judicial indepdence has been severely undermined

558809627656192009,4,Here
558809724796272671,652,The Constitutional Tribunal is the first victim of the reform. The tribunal is still in place_ but its independence and legitimacy have been seriously undermined.NLNL“I call on all political forces to engage in good faith in a constructive dialogue aimed at restoring the authority of the tribunal and its role as guarantor of the supremacy of the constitution.”NLNLThe Supreme Court was also at risk of being undermined_ the Special Rapporteur said. Reforms currently under way would potentially weaken its independence and capacity to ensure checks and balances_ and to protect and promote human rights_ he noted in a statement at the end of his mission.
558810098873532426,26,Well here's how I see that
558810366134452224,216,The judicial indepdence of a nation affects very very much how a other institutions like the legislative function. So maybe this one doesn't destroy the judiciary_ but it's opening the door to consolidation of power.
558810422116089867,84,There's really no other reason to do what's been done *besides* to consolidate power
558810987537629196,37,Trump's disapproval rating has surged

558813238259875868,53,Hillary the one who cited Henry Kissinger as a friend
558813351648559104,72,No because Clinton has a conniving and political ability Trump does not.
558813514731356171,48,Trump is fucking stupid. He has an oatmeal brain
558813740858867722,230,Reminder that Henry Kissinger signed off on:NLNL1. The coup in Chile NLNL2.Support for Pol PotNLNL3. The carpet bombing of LaosNLNL4. He was personal friends with_ and praised_ Jorge Videla. Jorge Videla was responsible for 20_000 deaths.
558814298357497866,132,Henry Kissinger is a monster. NLNLHere's a quote: "These matters are too important for the Chilean people to *decide for themselves*."
558814469778702395,129,Trump also doesn't have any actual positions. Remember when he told the Australian PM that he preferred their healthcare to ours?
558814538531602432,27,Proof <@378627967435145219>
558814597818220554,51,As far as I know the FBI didn't even investigate it
558814646597976086,19,Uh that's not proof
558814758506070027,115,You can confirm anyone to the Supreme Court. That doesn't mean they're innocent. The fuck kind of argument is that.
558814835320553513,51,Clarence Thomas is also guilty of sexual harassment
558815150069514240,59,So are you admitting you're wrong? Where's that FBI report?
558815224623398923,59,Post the FBI investigation clearing Kavanaugh why don't you
558815600395157524,146,Yeah they wanted to do it but didn't get basically any approval to do interviews. That's not finding out it was false. You are misrepresenting it.
558815726635319326,87,Gun control to a point can be good. I'd like a driver's license type test to own a gun.
558815826657017857,72,Universal background checks and a test to buy a gun is all I really want
558816052478345250,89,<@66164051062816768> for any gun sale to go through a background check should be required
558816173005733888,36,You're a condescending prick_ Chaos.
558816289502527496,137,Ok so illegally obtained is not the same thing as bought illegally. Those are mostly bought legally then illegally given to other people.
558816371366952962,24,Show me where I did that
558816447921389571,52,Which buzzwords were those that I used? Specifically
558816549184733216,30,Yeah I'm popping out for a bit
558842155397808149,27,They haven't been reforming
558842312579612704,134,They've been pretending to while continuing the wholescale slaughter in Yemen and prosecuting women who campaigned for driving rights.
558842331239809024,19,It's a P.R campaign
558843225226477588,30,That's a severe understatement
558843237947670548,15,It's a genocide
558843712805797889,24,I would call it genocide
558843849846292481,22,GenocideWatch does too
558843874446016513,34,http://www.genocidewatch.com/yemen
558843933291970575,46,It's a 9 out of 10 on their stages of genocide
558844055392354315,38,The goal doesn't have to be wiping out
558844235453956116,19,Not entirely anyway
558844274129633281,44,It can be a point to in *part* wipe them out
558844922443202561,100,I'm against it because I think children should have the right to choose a permanent change like that
