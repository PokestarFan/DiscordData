558784850564349952,r/teenagers,serious-personal,395,I hurt my leg in school today. I must’ve accidentally slammed it against a wall at some point exiting a class or something. I tell my step mother and she consoles me and gives me a cream to treat itNLNLI come back home_ tell my father the exact same lines I told my step mother and he gives me a dirty look_ accuses me of having hurt it by climbing a wall and tells me to not be an idiot next time
558784871921614869,r/teenagers,serious-personal,1,🙃
558785117296787476,r/teenagers,serious-personal,65,Are you kidding me? He went from calm demeanour to outright angry
558785148863250453,r/teenagers,serious-personal,26,Just because I hurt my leg
558785222305513482,r/teenagers,serious-personal,31,And in a malicious tone as well
558785257541861377,r/teenagers,serious-personal,29,Not even playful or consoling
558785511486128148,r/teenagers,serious-personal,94,It’s not nice to come home to have your father patronise you for accidentally hurting your leg
558785568448708648,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,I don’t get it
558785588111736865,r/teenagers,serious-personal,19,Why is he like this
558785742822703124,r/teenagers,serious-personal,103,He then comes down to the bathroom where I was washing my hands and doesn’t even say a word or anything
558785764775690241,r/teenagers,serious-personal,20,Just gives me a look
558785868182192130,r/teenagers,serious-personal,106,I noped the fuck out_ put the cream on my leg and went to bed before he has a chance to say anything to me
558785965649559553,r/teenagers,serious-personal,63,You don’t get it. There’s no talking to him when he’s like that
558786007974150145,r/teenagers,serious-personal,58,When he gets in this mood he’s always the one in the right
558786032947167243,r/teenagers,serious-personal,21,Only he is ever right
558786211062480896,r/teenagers,serious-personal,40,I try to talk to him and he won’t listen
558786419733168179,r/teenagers,serious-personal,96,He’s got issues and won’t ever address them because therapy is for crazy people according to him
558786477023166504,r/teenagers,serious-personal,27,I swear to god he’s bipolar
558786600369389609,r/teenagers,serious-personal,18,Sorry to hear that
558786659034988564,r/teenagers,serious-personal,13,I’m just lost
558786674042077213,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,I don’t get it
558786712583798797,r/teenagers,serious-personal,30,He was fine and then he wasn’t
558786751506939915,r/teenagers,serious-personal,40,Like someone flipped a switch inside him
558786777775865869,r/teenagers,serious-personal,11,It pains me
558786798025703434,r/teenagers,serious-personal,34,I just want a normal father but no
558786833429954561,r/teenagers,serious-personal,36,I had to get the crazy music fanatic
558786906075299853,r/teenagers,serious-personal,79,Who’s probably bipolar and has major mental issues but won’t ever talk about it
558787000480563227,r/teenagers,serious-personal,102,I want a normal home life but no_ I have to be worried about if he’s coming home in a good mood or not
558787107632578571,r/teenagers,serious-personal,102,Or if he’s gonna get in one of his moods and “teach” me music where he expects you to get it first try
558787174204702752,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,I’m not strong
558787217502371860,r/teenagers,serious-personal,35,This shit has worn me down mentally
558787275052285953,r/teenagers,serious-personal,71,The only time I can forget all that and pretend I’m normal is at school
558787389791666188,r/teenagers,serious-personal,46,When it’s constantly every 2-3 days I doubt it
558787409719066634,r/teenagers,serious-personal,21,It’s been 5 years now
558787423564333087,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,I ain’t strong
558787470372765698,r/teenagers,serious-personal,57,And will probably only ever be when I’m out of this house
558787612945547265,r/teenagers,serious-personal,35,He won’t be here tomorrow thank god
558787632579215367,r/teenagers,serious-personal,18,I’m free for a day
558787849588047873,r/teenagers,serious-personal,164,I can do whatever I want without him patronising me constantly. Nothing bad of course_ literally just taking a walk but he always insists that I stay near the house
558787908929060874,r/teenagers,serious-personal,24,Well_ if that’s the case
558788103209222154,r/teenagers,serious-personal,159,I’m a complex teenager who has major issues himself and will probably have the sad switch flipped on when he gets home and pretends everything is fine for once
558788160016875530,r/teenagers,serious-personal,31,After a wholesome day at school
558788240836919311,r/teenagers,serious-personal,20,I don’t care anymore
558788253021503489,r/teenagers,serious-personal,12,2 more years
558788266162389014,r/teenagers,serious-personal,12,And I’m gone
558788359070285832,r/teenagers,serious-personal,99,I’ll get a therapist and talk about my shitty feelings and get these shitty thoughts out of my head
558788400384311336,r/teenagers,serious-personal,29,And maybe I can live at peace
558789020071493644,r/teenagers,serious-personal,28,I won’t ever resort to drugs
558789056062947338,r/teenagers,serious-personal,49,I’ve seen enough crap to go down that rabbit hole
558789123385589802,r/teenagers,serious-personal,4,Well
558789140250886164,r/teenagers,serious-personal,17,Hopefully one day
558789171863355393,r/teenagers,serious-personal,30,I’ll stop feeling these things
558789196337119232,r/teenagers,serious-personal,26,And feel something genuine
558789290604232704,r/teenagers,serious-personal,33,Can’t take initiative. I’ve tried
558789322791321600,r/teenagers,serious-personal,40,I have actually yelled at my father once
558789380521590804,r/teenagers,serious-personal,52,To get his shit straight and to stop being like this
558789502580293652,r/teenagers,serious-personal,83,Why should he be able to talk shit to me and my brothers but when I do it it’s bad?
558789698324135938,r/teenagers,serious-personal,11,Haha oh man
558789714774327297,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,I’m so screwed
558789733501894658,r/teenagers,serious-personal,18,Music school yaaay
558789792033406976,r/teenagers,serious-personal,70,Can’t wait for another 2 years at something I’m good at but don’t like
558789869065732096,r/teenagers,serious-personal,11,Itll be fun
558789969414717443,r/teenagers,serious-personal,38,I’ll be the dream my old man never had
558790297149243396,r/teenagers,serious-personal,12,I can’t dude
558790307471294491,r/teenagers,serious-personal,16,It’s over for me
558790330401423380,r/teenagers,serious-personal,35,Might as well just go along with it
558790346793025567,r/teenagers,serious-personal,18,Least it pays well
558790436626366494,r/teenagers,serious-personal,60,Maybe with someone kinder as my teacher I’ll grow to like it
558790551466541101,r/teenagers,serious-personal,79,Because if I take control of my own life I lose my old man. I’ll be dead to him
558790620726951936,r/teenagers,serious-personal,37,If I ain’t a musician I’m dead to him
558790767372402700,r/teenagers,serious-personal,50,And it’s not like I haven’t tried to improve yeah?
558790807054974977,r/teenagers,serious-personal,13,Day after day
558790898243338240,r/teenagers,serious-personal,17,Nothing’s changed
558791270428835851,r/teenagers,serious-personal,222,I’ve practiced my instrument by myself without my fatherNLNLI’ve been doing more exercise by myself NLNLI’ve been eating healthier NLNLI’ve been going out moreNLNLI’ve interacted with more people at my school and made more friends
558791424393609246,r/teenagers,serious-personal,54,I’m telling you_ I’m only ever unhappy at my own house
558791449164906529,r/teenagers,serious-personal,12,I have tried
558791461018271754,r/teenagers,serious-personal,10,Many times
558791478684549123,r/teenagers,serious-personal,23,So many I’ve lost count
558791496048967710,r/teenagers,serious-personal,21,But he doesn’t listen
558791621097947154,r/teenagers,serious-personal,108,He won’t ever listen and he won’t ever change. He promises change but that’s been a dead promise for 5 years
558791669563130100,r/teenagers,serious-personal,46,So what am I supposed to do. My hands are tied
558791718716178434,r/teenagers,serious-personal,24,I can’t do anything else
558792042122313729,r/teenagers,serious-personal,12,I’m so tired
558792059377418240,r/teenagers,serious-personal,22,I just want it to stop
558792104705523742,r/teenagers,serious-personal,23,I can’t do this anymore
558792135361691698,r/teenagers,serious-personal,34,I can’t keep this farce any longer
558792262029541396,r/teenagers,serious-personal,41,I wish I could’ve had a different outcome
558792470884778035,r/teenagers,serious-personal,47,I would’ve left him years ago but I can’t leave
558792479877496833,r/teenagers,serious-personal,9,My mother
558792551960936461,r/teenagers,serious-personal,59,She will be all alone with him and she’ll be so heartbroken
558792593253728268,r/teenagers,serious-personal,36,And I love her too much to leave her
558792670130995215,r/teenagers,serious-personal,44,He’ll probably take his anger out on her too
558792736493273108,r/teenagers,serious-personal,6,I just
558792941343080449,r/teenagers,serious-personal,144,Want it to stop and it hasn’t stopped for 6 goddamn years. I thought after I chose him instead of my step mother everything would be over but no
558793028089675777,r/teenagers,serious-personal,75,I can’t ever catch a break I always have to have one bullshit after another
558793162219454474,r/teenagers,serious-personal,48,Only at school and when I’m by myself in my room
558793242087391253,r/teenagers,serious-personal,60,I want to go out and take walks but the old man won’t let me
558793375617253387,r/teenagers,serious-personal,16,Haha yeah I wish
558793440695943208,r/teenagers,serious-personal,67,He’ll probably have a stroke the second I leave without telling him
558793503786795009,r/teenagers,serious-personal,6,I have
558793520501227523,r/teenagers,serious-personal,15,On one occasion
558793573525618708,r/teenagers,serious-personal,43,I told him everything that I thought of him
558793602029846528,r/teenagers,serious-personal,22,Afterwards I felt good
558793620719796225,r/teenagers,serious-personal,10,Great even
558793680119398428,r/teenagers,serious-personal,42,Then he sent my and my brothers to my room
558793732015521801,r/teenagers,serious-personal,39,And we stayed there the whole afternoon
558793772604063745,r/teenagers,serious-personal,29,And I just watched the sunset
558793887276072970,r/teenagers,serious-personal,76,The orange colours mixing with purple and creating pretty colours in my room
558793923443818516,r/teenagers,serious-personal,19,And the shadows too
558793967844720680,r/teenagers,serious-personal,39,And for once in my life I felt at peace
558794009988825129,r/teenagers,serious-personal,16,And it was sweet
558794095099772929,r/teenagers,serious-personal,4,Yeah
558794109259612170,r/teenagers,serious-personal,9,I miss it
558794143174885432,r/teenagers,serious-personal,22,I miss a lot of things
558794182190301187,r/teenagers,serious-personal,23,Oh and younger brothers
558794200296980513,r/teenagers,serious-personal,20,I’m the middle child
558794316324274177,r/teenagers,serious-personal,21,He’s a french teacher
558794344707129353,r/teenagers,serious-personal,12,Finished uni
558794445009584128,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,That’s awesome
558794494846435329,r/teenagers,serious-personal,30,French is a very cool language
558794510671282177,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,Comment ca va?
558794891359158302,r/teenagers,serious-personal,40,Well_ thanks dude <@!373874896352182273>
558794924049563678,r/teenagers,serious-personal,27,I’m gonna sleep of this now
558794996950630400,r/teenagers,serious-personal,53,Maybe tomorrow after a long walk I’ll feel fine again
558795014419906620,r/teenagers,serious-personal,12,Sure_ thanks
558795038616846339,r/teenagers,serious-personal,23,A listener is a godsend
560602641005150222,r/teenagers,self,27,Explain the meaning of life
560603141205131277,r/teenagers,self,45,Wish I had a mirror to take full body pics of
560603223430266900,r/teenagers,self,91,The only places that have mirrors are the room that we don’t use. Which is filled with junk
560603270792609802,r/teenagers,self,26,And it ruins the aesthetic
560604632758616076,r/teenagers,serious-personal,56,But because I don’t relate at all with other kids my age
