560649483675762718,107,sup so i got a question involving a super smelter and i was curious to see if any of you knew how to fix it
560650707708149770,602,I play on the windows 10 edition. I copied somebody's design for a super smelter in Minecraft the original design called for six smelters but I increased it to 15 it just uses hoppers redstone repeater_ comparator and dust. But for some reason it only smelts part of a full stack we use this smelter for everything bulk and not bulk. It will smelt like 60 and leave the rest in smelter but I cant find it and it doesn't smelt them until I put more items in_ How would I fix this? Also_ I just found that it keeps them in the bottom feed hopper and doesn't push them out until the hopper is full I think
