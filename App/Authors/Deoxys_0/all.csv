559061034074374144,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,306,If you have a world size that is restricted to 2016×2016 (126×126 chunks).... What is the chance_ if any at all_ of getting a world with at least one of each of the following?NL-Ocean MonumentNL-JungleNL-Pine TreesNL-SavannahNL-Ice/SnowNL-Dark ForestNL-MansionNL-VillageNL-Desert (either red or not; doesn't matter)
559061919445811213,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,180,On 3DS? probably not lol; I don't like playing games on my phone and I do not own a Switch_ so 3DS is the ONLY "mobile" Minecraft I have; I do the full Java version on my PC though
559061988664279040,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,76,that's why I mentioned I'm about to give up and just lug my laptop around x)
559062173674897458,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,90,The 3DS version is written in C++ though; it probably doesn't apply to any of those things
559062349256851486,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,112,the only reason I asked in bedrock was because it also has limited world sizes based on the version you're using
559062606799700001,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,277,I really wish for any version of Minecraft that has limited world sizes_ they would add a setting that you can enable if you wanted that basically said "one of every main biome type and structure will spawn"; it may result in a weird looking map_ but it would be really helpful
559062781358374942,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,87,maybe I should just buy a Switch_ although doesn't it also have limited world sizes? x)
559063258598866945,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,194,<@!201035729692786698> I'll probably keep trying for a bit longer as I am willing to sack some things off_ such as red sand (which is rarer than regular sand) and a mansion_ as well as a village
559063402912284683,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,261,when it comes to tree types in regards to biomes like the savannah and dark woods_ honestly I'll be happy if I just get a piece of a biome (like on the edge) with like one tree spawned lol; I mainly want access to every tree type_ not necessarily the full biome
