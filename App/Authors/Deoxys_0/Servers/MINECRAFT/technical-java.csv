559065639181090817,678,Okay..... Can someone help me out here please? I'm considering going back to my java version of Minecraft due to annoying limitations with other versions_ but if I'm going to do that_ I'm going to mod it like crazy. What are the best mods_ if any_ that are still kept up to date that meet the following things?NL-Multiple dimensions.NL-New mobs.NL-New bosses.NL-Automation.NL-Storage.NL-'Sciencey' type stuff.NL-More biomes.NL-More randomly generated structures.NL-Technical stuff_ like advanced redstone.NLI have some mods in mind_ but I'm worried that they may not be compatible with each other or may cause a "clown vomit" world generation due to too many things being present at once.
