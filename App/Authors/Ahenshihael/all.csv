558992898947940363,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,52,this oneNLhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHuyXJGbbTM
558992920682954763,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,6,I mean
558992933995413561,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,26,hitsugaya is hella popular
558992951007772688,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,22,thank to all the fujos
558993553166958612,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,6,you do
558993568648265750,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,but tbh byakuya has it's fandom
558993602282520587,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,55,but it pales in comparison to uh_ Hitsugaya and Shuuhei
558993628509241354,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,38,or whatever the 69 face guy's name was
558993863902101514,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,24,shuhei gets shipped with
558993868507316234,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,2,uh
558993885775527947,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,36,literally every other male character
558993894260604938,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,9,in bleach
558993897372516353,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,7,so yeah
558994090725998643,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,17,hitsugaya is like
558994109897900075,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,34,the top dog in terms of popularity
558994123407753230,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,28,out of all bleach characters
558994155380932628,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,59,beating even MC which is very unusual for shonen demo works
558994241074757646,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,24,Kira is also popular-ish
558994383165325317,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,70,I mean.... (Bleach) || she already _is_ that by end of manga so? ðŸ¤·  ||
558994448998989834,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,53,I mean_ yes she was but (Bleach) || She got hotter ||
558994750288691201,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,72,she's the most consistent looking character after Ichigo in bleach tho ðŸ¤·
558995196826746899,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,12,the emo boye
558995323075166228,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,81,but yeah_ overall bleach ending character designs all were a huge improvement tbh
558995355723890698,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,58,unlike some other shonen manga where it makes you go "wut"
558995413613412371,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,80,all the changes made  sense in terms of characters and everybody looked fine  af
558995743096963091,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,88,and I mean that ecchi image is not that different from (bleach)  || her ending design ||
558995807617941515,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,46,I'd say that one is still the superior version
558995893735522306,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,15,(bleach ending)
558995903386746901,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,22,this is still top tier
558995929064275988,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,as far as design evolution goes
558995934076207104,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,<:GWumuSmug:399090735607185418>
558996164825841664,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,28,eh_ its fitting look for him
558996580410327041,/r/Anime Discord!,games,20,Atlus: Hold our beer
559011468553748491,/r/Anime Discord!,films-tv,11,makes sense
559033454961098763,/r/Anime Discord!,games,70,that's because its obviously  coming to PS4 and fuck all else is known
559033552017293319,/r/Anime Discord!,games,44,it also lines up with sony marketing efforts
559034330689699841,/r/Anime Discord!,games,51,that's why we can't rule out possibility of PC port
559034348725338122,/r/Anime Discord!,games,27,even if its not that likely
559034544498409472,/r/Anime Discord!,games,110,Switch mainly comes from both joker in smash  and all the rumors surrounding that so far having been confirmed
559034629068161030,/r/Anime Discord!,games,54,including a new possibly fem mc skin for joker I guess
559034834144591877,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,6,i mean
559034853308366856,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,23,NGE _is_ an action show
559034888230141972,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,26,in same way pacific rim is
559035088474734593,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,30,most of episodes have fighting
559035139242328066,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,67,a show being action show does not stop  it from having other things
559035471221620738,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,35,that's the way to sell the show tho
559035520647430156,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,47,in fact that's the way eva has always been sold
559035944221540362,/r/Anime Discord!,games,56,its only logical to do  more elaborate changes next time
559036133896355869,/r/Anime Discord!,games,39,but P3P mc _is_ different character tho
559036381502898206,/r/Anime Discord!,games,103,so that way you can have the choice as a sort of "new game plus" for people who already played the game
559038293782822912,/r/Anime Discord!,games,92,unless its for some final smash bs where some other ponytail character shows up or something
559038541808664577,/r/Anime Discord!,games,82,I will only get it if its on switch and has fem mc option that has different story
559038560066600985,/r/Anime Discord!,games,42,otherwise <:TohruShrug:381906773486993408>
559039727341273093,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,17,anime is _flawed_
559039730608635926,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,3,oof
559039748635754517,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,40,it skips a lot of fun content from manga
559039776272023560,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,64,because it wanted to catch up to manga so people would buy manga
559039782412353546,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,37,<:GWpinkuSadOtato:393081466176667648>
559039891833356299,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,23,SH is still going yeah?
559040157542645803,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,72,didn't narita write latest volume on a phone or some shit? due to health
559041055903842312,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,21,MAL is not consistent
