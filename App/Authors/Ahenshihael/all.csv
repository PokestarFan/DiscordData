558993553166958612,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,6,you do
558993568648265750,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,but tbh byakuya has it's fandom
558993602282520587,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,55,but it pales in comparison to uh_ Hitsugaya and Shuuhei
558993628509241354,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,38,or whatever the 69 face guy's name was
558993863902101514,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,24,shuhei gets shipped with

558993897372516353,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,7,so yeah
558994090725998643,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,17,hitsugaya is like
558994109897900075,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,34,the top dog in terms of popularity
558994123407753230,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,28,out of all bleach characters
558994155380932628,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,59,beating even MC which is very unusual for shonen demo works
558994241074757646,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,24,Kira is also popular-ish
558994383165325317,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,70,I mean.... (Bleach) || she already _is_ that by end of manga so? ðŸ¤·  ||
558994448998989834,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,53,I mean_ yes she was but (Bleach) || She got hotter ||
558994750288691201,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,72,she's the most consistent looking character after Ichigo in bleach tho ðŸ¤·
558995196826746899,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,12,the emo boye
558995323075166228,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,81,but yeah_ overall bleach ending character designs all were a huge improvement tbh
558995355723890698,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,58,unlike some other shonen manga where it makes you go "wut"
558995413613412371,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,80,all the changes made  sense in terms of characters and everybody looked fine  af
558995743096963091,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,88,and I mean that ecchi image is not that different from (bleach)  || her ending design ||
558995807617941515,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,46,I'd say that one is still the superior version
558995893735522306,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,15,(bleach ending)
558995903386746901,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,22,this is still top tier
558995929064275988,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,as far as design evolution goes
558995934076207104,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,<:GWumuSmug:399090735607185418>
558996164825841664,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,28,eh_ its fitting look for him

559011468553748491,/r/Anime Discord!,films-tv,11,makes sense
559033454961098763,/r/Anime Discord!,games,70,that's because its obviously  coming to PS4 and fuck all else is known
559033552017293319,/r/Anime Discord!,games,44,it also lines up with sony marketing efforts
