558992920682954763,6,I mean
558992933995413561,26,hitsugaya is hella popular
558992951007772688,22,thank to all the fujos
558993553166958612,6,you do
558993568648265750,31,but tbh byakuya has it's fandom
558993602282520587,55,but it pales in comparison to uh_ Hitsugaya and Shuuhei
558993628509241354,38,or whatever the 69 face guy's name was
558993863902101514,24,shuhei gets shipped with
558993868507316234,2,uh
558993885775527947,36,literally every other male character
558993894260604938,9,in bleach
558993897372516353,7,so yeah
558994090725998643,17,hitsugaya is like
558994109897900075,34,the top dog in terms of popularity
558994123407753230,28,out of all bleach characters
558994155380932628,59,beating even MC which is very unusual for shonen demo works
558994241074757646,24,Kira is also popular-ish
558994383165325317,70,I mean.... (Bleach) || she already _is_ that by end of manga so? ðŸ¤·  ||
558994448998989834,53,I mean_ yes she was but (Bleach) || She got hotter ||
558994750288691201,72,she's the most consistent looking character after Ichigo in bleach tho ðŸ¤·
558995196826746899,12,the emo boye
558995323075166228,81,but yeah_ overall bleach ending character designs all were a huge improvement tbh
558995355723890698,58,unlike some other shonen manga where it makes you go "wut"
558995413613412371,80,all the changes made  sense in terms of characters and everybody looked fine  af
558995743096963091,88,and I mean that ecchi image is not that different from (bleach)  || her ending design ||
558995807617941515,46,I'd say that one is still the superior version
558995893735522306,15,(bleach ending)
558995903386746901,22,this is still top tier
558995929064275988,31,as far as design evolution goes
558995934076207104,31,<:GWumuSmug:399090735607185418>
558996164825841664,28,eh_ its fitting look for him
559034834144591877,6,i mean
559034853308366856,23,NGE _is_ an action show
559034888230141972,26,in same way pacific rim is
559035088474734593,30,most of episodes have fighting
559035139242328066,67,a show being action show does not stop  it from having other things
559035471221620738,35,that's the way to sell the show tho
559035520647430156,47,in fact that's the way eva has always been sold
559039727341273093,17,anime is _flawed_
559039730608635926,3,oof
559039748635754517,40,it skips a lot of fun content from manga
559039776272023560,64,because it wanted to catch up to manga so people would buy manga
559039782412353546,37,<:GWpinkuSadOtato:393081466176667648>
559039891833356299,23,SH is still going yeah?
559040157542645803,72,didn't narita write latest volume on a phone or some shit? due to health
559041055903842312,21,MAL is not consistent
