559033454961098763,70,that's because its obviously  coming to PS4 and fuck all else is known
559033552017293319,44,it also lines up with sony marketing efforts
559034330689699841,51,that's why we can't rule out possibility of PC port
559034348725338122,27,even if its not that likely
559034544498409472,110,Switch mainly comes from both joker in smash  and all the rumors surrounding that so far having been confirmed
559034629068161030,54,including a new possibly fem mc skin for joker I guess
559035944221540362,56,its only logical to do  more elaborate changes next time
559036133896355869,39,but P3P mc _is_ different character tho
559036381502898206,103,so that way you can have the choice as a sort of "new game plus" for people who already played the game
559038293782822912,92,unless its for some final smash bs where some other ponytail character shows up or something
559038541808664577,82,I will only get it if its on switch and has fem mc option that has different story
559038560066600985,42,otherwise <:TohruShrug:381906773486993408>
