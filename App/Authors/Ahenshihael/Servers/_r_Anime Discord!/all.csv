558994123407753230,anime,28,out of all bleach characters
558994155380932628,anime,59,beating even MC which is very unusual for shonen demo works

558995196826746899,anime,12,the emo boye
558995323075166228,anime,81,but yeah_ overall bleach ending character designs all were a huge improvement tbh
558995355723890698,anime,58,unlike some other shonen manga where it makes you go "wut"
558995413613412371,anime,80,all the changes made  sense in terms of characters and everybody looked fine  af
558995743096963091,anime,88,and I mean that ecchi image is not that different from (bleach)  || her ending design ||
558995807617941515,anime,46,I'd say that one is still the superior version
558995893735522306,anime,15,(bleach ending)
558995903386746901,anime,22,this is still top tier
