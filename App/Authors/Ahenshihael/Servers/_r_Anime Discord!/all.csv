558990870838378527,anime,96,tldr: girl dislikes painful sh it so she literally dumps all her stats into DEF. Hilarity ensues
558992096573390848,anime,167,I mean_ its a game and for random shit (def build heroine thing) || does getting hit by a random  developer nerf once in a while count? <:haHAA:517113177125814293>  ||
558992412647751680,anime,26,oooh the gun-head thing pv

558992863946604566,anime,27,now wait wrong trailer lmao
558992898947940363,anime,52,this oneNLhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHuyXJGbbTM
558992920682954763,anime,6,I mean
558992933995413561,anime,26,hitsugaya is hella popular
558992951007772688,anime,22,thank to all the fujos
558993553166958612,anime,6,you do
558993568648265750,anime,31,but tbh byakuya has it's fandom
558993602282520587,anime,55,but it pales in comparison to uh_ Hitsugaya and Shuuhei
558993628509241354,anime,38,or whatever the 69 face guy's name was
558993863902101514,anime,24,shuhei gets shipped with
558993868507316234,anime,2,uh
558993885775527947,anime,36,literally every other male character
558993894260604938,anime,9,in bleach
558993897372516353,anime,7,so yeah
558994090725998643,anime,17,hitsugaya is like
558994109897900075,anime,34,the top dog in terms of popularity
558994123407753230,anime,28,out of all bleach characters
558994155380932628,anime,59,beating even MC which is very unusual for shonen demo works
558994241074757646,anime,24,Kira is also popular-ish
558994383165325317,anime,70,I mean.... (Bleach) || she already _is_ that by end of manga so? ðŸ¤·  ||
558994448998989834,anime,53,I mean_ yes she was but (Bleach) || She got hotter ||
558994750288691201,anime,72,she's the most consistent looking character after Ichigo in bleach tho ðŸ¤·
558995196826746899,anime,12,the emo boye
558995323075166228,anime,81,but yeah_ overall bleach ending character designs all were a huge improvement tbh
558995355723890698,anime,58,unlike some other shonen manga where it makes you go "wut"
558995413613412371,anime,80,all the changes made  sense in terms of characters and everybody looked fine  af
558995743096963091,anime,88,and I mean that ecchi image is not that different from (bleach)  || her ending design ||
558995807617941515,anime,46,I'd say that one is still the superior version
558995893735522306,anime,15,(bleach ending)
558995903386746901,anime,22,this is still top tier
558995929064275988,anime,31,as far as design evolution goes
558995934076207104,anime,31,<:GWumuSmug:399090735607185418>
558996164825841664,anime,28,eh_ its fitting look for him
558996580410327041,games,20,Atlus: Hold our beer
559011468553748491,films-tv,11,makes sense
559033454961098763,games,70,that's because its obviously  coming to PS4 and fuck all else is known
559033552017293319,games,44,it also lines up with sony marketing efforts
559034330689699841,games,51,that's why we can't rule out possibility of PC port
559034348725338122,games,27,even if its not that likely
559034544498409472,games,110,Switch mainly comes from both joker in smash  and all the rumors surrounding that so far having been confirmed
559034629068161030,games,54,including a new possibly fem mc skin for joker I guess
559034834144591877,anime,6,i mean
559034853308366856,anime,23,NGE _is_ an action show
559034888230141972,anime,26,in same way pacific rim is
559035088474734593,anime,30,most of episodes have fighting
559035139242328066,anime,67,a show being action show does not stop  it from having other things
559035471221620738,anime,35,that's the way to sell the show tho
559035520647430156,anime,47,in fact that's the way eva has always been sold
559035944221540362,games,56,its only logical to do  more elaborate changes next time
559036133896355869,games,39,but P3P mc _is_ different character tho
559036381502898206,games,103,so that way you can have the choice as a sort of "new game plus" for people who already played the game
559038293782822912,games,92,unless its for some final smash bs where some other ponytail character shows up or something
559038541808664577,games,82,I will only get it if its on switch and has fem mc option that has different story
559038560066600985,games,42,otherwise <:TohruShrug:381906773486993408>
559039727341273093,anime,17,anime is _flawed_
559039730608635926,anime,3,oof
559039748635754517,anime,40,it skips a lot of fun content from manga
559039776272023560,anime,64,because it wanted to catch up to manga so people would buy manga
559039782412353546,anime,37,<:GWpinkuSadOtato:393081466176667648>
559039891833356299,anime,23,SH is still going yeah?
559040157542645803,anime,72,didn't narita write latest volume on a phone or some shit? due to health
559041055903842312,anime,21,MAL is not consistent
559100170625876015,anime,7,MR is ðŸ‘Œ
559100231707525130,anime,134,alicization has flaws but at least it spends decent  amount of time on characters and has some of best fight animations to date in sao
559100436356005909,anime,33,all I know about it is the title_
559100455154745357,anime,44,I'm happy not knowing anything else about it
559100460653477909,anime,31,<:GWumuSmug:399090735607185418>
559100552550547477,anime,69,it was okay thing to tide me over till next gatari but nothing more ðŸ¤·
559100708742365185,anime,118,it had some nice banter but the moment I'd try to pick it apart _ the show would most likely fall apart(unlike gatari)
559100741956927488,anime,49,also_ bunny's MC is nowhere near ararararagi_ sry
559100842196598784,anime,3,oof
559100964402102312,anime,149,I mean even bunny's MC felt like its basically "I want to write Kyon but without any sort of thought behind it so let's just make him a snarky dude "
559101062729039873,anime,98,which hey_ gave some great dialogue with other characters_ but  on his own he's nobody interesting
559101119113199637,anime,80,I can see how that kind of shit can be incredibly annoying if written even worse
559101279327223811,anime,109,like my biggest problem with  bunnygirl is that it literally was discount-gatari without the charm or the wit
559101728272810029,anime,106,let's just put it this way - the only reason I remember just because _existed_ is because it was mentioned
559101732966236162,anime,27,<:haHAA:517113177125814293>
559102037024047104,anime,123,Either way_ this shot has better composition than and aesthetic than entirety of bunny girl <:GWumuSmug:399090735607185418>
559102171040186388,anime,4,hana
559102194763300904,anime,25,the most beautiful gatari
559102219610226692,anime,31,also known as sceneryporngatari
559102318432354315,anime,0,
559104832179273759,anime,37,that whole scene is just ooof perfect
559107128103796747,anime,42,sailor moon originated a lot of big people
559107132868263948,anime,7,ikuhara
559107137725267995,anime,8,igarashi
559107140904812545,anime,3,etc
