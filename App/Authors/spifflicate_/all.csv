558805035341971456,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,522,ive been thinking and reminiscing lately. I remember when this big confession thing from my then-crush happened back in middle school_ and I've just been thinking about this one other guy a year older than me that I lead on during the time. I didn't mean for it to be hurtful but I can see why it would have. We were texting each other everyday and he was leading up to a song he wrote that he says was a surprise. And then the whole confession thing happened and i was freaking out_ and I just completely disregarded him.
