558794113298726922,533,LF a clan supporting NAE minors (As in kids) I am 11 y/o and looking for a decent clan that does payed tourneys (I'm not looking for one that will do them in the future I want them to be current) I really don't feel like taking the time to type up a resume so it would be great if we could just hop into a call and I could tell you a bit about myself (Please note that the clan needs to have atleast 50 members) and have a nice day! PM me with info on the clan please don't PM me with the invite instantly I want to know a bit first.
