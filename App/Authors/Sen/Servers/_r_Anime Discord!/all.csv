558439732741275662,anime,338,the irony is that rape is a huge genre in doujins which are very popular among anime fans yet when it happens in a show all of a sudden everyone is like "oh noes_ why did they sexualize this_ can't handle it_ gonna faint" Edit: already finished writing this before you said move on_ so gonna leave it as my final reply_ don't kill me Beef

558458475550867496,anime,145,Moribito || show was great in the first arc but now that it started to focus on the characters a lot more it started getting better and better ||
558459051705499665,anime,58,thanks for recommending it_ I wasn't aware how good it was

558765171561201665,anime,83,speaking of fate VNs and stuff_ sometimes I feel like reading VNs but decide not to
558765194747183105,anime,23,community way too niche
558765276263612432,anime,79,you spend so much time on them and you barely have people to talk to about them
558789989224284160,anime,83,is this a reinterpretation or something? or no longer human has always been sci fi?
558790016596180992,anime,17,had no idea if so
558790257596956692,anime,44,except they function fundamentally different
558790355437223953,anime,42,lighting abilities were invented by naruto
558791641461424132,anime,40,take weebs for example_ they use lolirgy

558827646545559562,anime,32,man_ besides looking gorgeous af
558827713977122857,anime,69,there's something else to moribito_ I think it's the shot composition
558827747556720650,anime,22,there's a lot of depth
558827859192446986,anime,87,when characters interact with the environment it really feels 3d and appropriately wide
558827892533100574,anime,55,for example when there's a serious fight in a big field
558827981359939602,anime,57,they do a really good job of making that field feel legit
558828689630953473,anime,19,yeah_ it's on point
558828843130028042,anime,9,well said
558829098072276993,anime,81,it's a mystery why this show is so under-watched and barely talked about nowadays
558829763347742779,anime,43,the fight 2 episodes later was also amazing
558829797464342559,anime,58,and what made me think about this a lot in the first place
558829852061466634,anime,51,then episode 14 was itself quite a visual spectacle
558831641271730176,anime,59,watching this also made me hyped up for Stand Alone Complex
558831664164241418,anime,25,which I did not watch yet
558831690055942155,anime,24,for no particular reason
558991037196926999,anime,47,but shieldbro has lolis so it has an edge on it

558992286969626624,anime,61,the outfit itself is great? but why is it in something madoka
558992765380329472,anime,43,at least they put the YYH cast in the front
558992845038420026,anime,45,name a better shounen protagonist than Yusuke
558992861740400651,anime,17,protip: you can't

558993980558278688,anime,26,I remember my Bleach phase
558994184086880267,anime,61,so Kubo made some art of the characters after the manga ended
558994251913101312,anime,68,turns out Orihime transformed into a hentai ara ara ultra thicc milf
558994304849149968,anime,4,yeah
