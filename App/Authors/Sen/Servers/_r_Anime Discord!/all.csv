558439130036437002,anime,115,anybody here watched Colorful? I really liked the movie and when I looked at the score turns out everybody hated it
558439732741275662,anime,338,the irony is that rape is a huge genre in doujins which are very popular among anime fans yet when it happens in a show all of a sudden everyone is like "oh noes_ why did they sexualize this_ can't handle it_ gonna faint" Edit: already finished writing this before you said move on_ so gonna leave it as my final reply_ don't kill me Beef

558449823800623104,anime,76,<@182974877479731201> yo_ the Moribito blacksmith episode was freaking great
558457164411306004,anime,133,<@182974877479731201> Moribito || I like how they go against the tropes and Chagum and his brother are actually really good people ||
558458475550867496,anime,145,Moribito || show was great in the first arc but now that it started to focus on the characters a lot more it started getting better and better ||
558459051705499665,anime,58,thanks for recommending it_ I wasn't aware how good it was
558459059594985497,anime,10,it's great
558760192741867531,anime,60,you could add KnK in there to make everything more enjoyable
558762286425309196,anime,66,cmon_ type moon ain't that complicated <:haHAA:529569462676881438>
558762317462896672,anime,20,here's a short guide
558762336308166659,anime,0,
558762939230847026,anime,54,and accidentally become a lolicon after watching illya
558765171561201665,anime,83,speaking of fate VNs and stuff_ sometimes I feel like reading VNs but decide not to
558765194747183105,anime,23,community way too niche
558765276263612432,anime,79,you spend so much time on them and you barely have people to talk to about them
558789989224284160,anime,83,is this a reinterpretation or something? or no longer human has always been sci fi?
558790016596180992,anime,17,had no idea if so
558790257596956692,anime,44,except they function fundamentally different
558790355437223953,anime,42,lighting abilities were invented by naruto
558791641461424132,anime,40,take weebs for example_ they use lolirgy
558791714559492117,anime,34,levi is adept at casting hardening
558792386411626516,anime,4,NANA
558799513129844751,anime,74,<@182974877479731201> Moribito || didn't know Chagum was medieval Akagi ||
558799793959469090,anime,27,Chagum is a great character

558806333713809408,anime,85,Moribito episode 11 || that moment when Tanda went into Nayug was freaking awesome ||
558807802894876712,anime,26,it was really great indeed
558827646545559562,anime,32,man_ besides looking gorgeous af
558827713977122857,anime,69,there's something else to moribito_ I think it's the shot composition
558827747556720650,anime,22,there's a lot of depth
558827859192446986,anime,87,when characters interact with the environment it really feels 3d and appropriately wide
558827892533100574,anime,55,for example when there's a serious fight in a big field
558827981359939602,anime,57,they do a really good job of making that field feel legit
558828689630953473,anime,19,yeah_ it's on point
558828843130028042,anime,9,well said
558829098072276993,anime,81,it's a mystery why this show is so under-watched and barely talked about nowadays
558829763347742779,anime,43,the fight 2 episodes later was also amazing
558829797464342559,anime,58,and what made me think about this a lot in the first place
558829852061466634,anime,51,then episode 14 was itself quite a visual spectacle
558831641271730176,anime,59,watching this also made me hyped up for Stand Alone Complex
558831664164241418,anime,25,which I did not watch yet
558831690055942155,anime,24,for no particular reason
558991037196926999,anime,47,but shieldbro has lolis so it has an edge on it
558992176466493440,anime,51,now we can talk about the lewd magia records design
558992193289715712,anime,55,https://shop.r10s.jp/kidsroom/cabinet/gacha11/g9549.jpg
558992286969626624,anime,61,the outfit itself is great? but why is it in something madoka
558992765380329472,anime,43,at least they put the YYH cast in the front
558992845038420026,anime,45,name a better shounen protagonist than Yusuke
558992861740400651,anime,17,protip: you can't
558993124953817089,anime,29,kengan asura will be full cg?
558993937981898762,anime,21,the Bleach soundtrack

558993980558278688,anime,26,I remember my Bleach phase
558994184086880267,anime,61,so Kubo made some art of the characters after the manga ended
558994251913101312,anime,68,turns out Orihime transformed into a hentai ara ara ultra thicc milf
558994304849149968,anime,4,yeah
558994372994138115,anime,21,she's extra thicc now
558994453592014869,anime,39,nah_ you don't know her post manga look

558995231438274583,anime,27,imagine not remembering Ulq
558995286379200512,anime,31,when did you watch Bleach Reef?
558995460208066560,anime,23,especially milf orihime
558995619042033664,anime,17,kubo went all out
558995650411495434,anime,43,even her choice of swimsuit is hentai level
558995968444596244,anime,27,this lacks the ara ara look
558995995195867136,anime,34,which makes any thicc waifu better
558996313841205259,anime,31,reef_ when did you watch bleach
558996760882577442,anime,22,he's trolling you mate
558996802691530764,anime,59,your message probably got removed because you were spamming
558996822585114644,anime,12,very quickly
558997151976390666,anime,63,that's good_ watching it as a teen is when you get maximum hype
558997261489668106,anime,57,I was probably around 14 when my bleach phase got serious
559005316013096980,anime,53,masamune was nowhere near rezero levels of popularity

559005663183896576,anime,22,for the smug main girl
559006027878498341,anime,22,that's someone's waifu
559006064272474125,anime,30,don't talk about her like that
559006312168423425,anime,31,https://i.imgur.com/3x2GSDp.jpg
559006351041495040,anime,13,this is great

559007103910543360,anime,10,if so_ yes
559007241257353218,anime,22,it will be most likely
559007279051964446,anime,34,arc 4 is apparently very long iirc
559007310098464768,anime,46,also_ they need to adapt the epilogue of arc 3
559007355975630868,anime,39,which they left out of the first season
559007683995500544,anime,57,no point in going to another channel just to type 4 lines
559007855039086623,anime,28,you know what would be great
559007884818645036,anime,21,golden kamuy season 3

559094142513315862,anime,29,so my scale is not consistent
559094212604461061,anime,54,much less any relevant when compared to other people's
559098068520402955,anime,86,the ultimate weeb watches and enjoys every single genre <:charhaha:447488960675971073>

560998987285659668,novels,51,that would mean it would take 80 hours to finish it
560999052419006485,novels,40,and I hear it's a 100 hour vn on average
561000089309544508,novels,78,howlongtobeat lists the questions arcs at 40 hours and answer arcs at 73 hours
