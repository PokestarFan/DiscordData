558433771683053578,129,sure I loved sorayori for example and find it amazing_ but no way it would overshadow something like Slayers which I grew up with
558434326371368969,4,Redo
558434336081313792,4,stfu
558434450359451651,36,Redo making everything about himself

558434547335954459,24,from now on_ you're Beef
558434817805385728,113,I watched shinsekai yori and then I read Animal Farm because I'm a man of culture <:shinocool:529569462681337856>
558435092125712384,18,Beef with the piss
558435118939766804,11,I mean bait
558435264213680143,60,all weebs are equal_ but some are more equal than the others
558435644393652225,166,Beef_ nobody made this political yet you decided to add that in just to have a reason to stop it when it didn't exist in the fist place <:waitwhat:490350733951238174>

558437590542450699,44,I hear they went ahead and changed the plot?
558437615859269642,18,that's a big no no
558438082353954816,47,you need to watch Vampire Hunter D and Bloolust
558438300105441282,46,the visuals in bloodlust are on fucking poinyt
558439130036437002,115,anybody here watched Colorful? I really liked the movie and when I looked at the score turns out everybody hated it
558439732741275662,338,the irony is that rape is a huge genre in doujins which are very popular among anime fans yet when it happens in a show all of a sudden everyone is like "oh noes_ why did they sexualize this_ can't handle it_ gonna faint" Edit: already finished writing this before you said move on_ so gonna leave it as my final reply_ don't kill me Beef
558439818074390528,8,oh_ okay

558441621746745344,56,(I keep seeing Hillary in WEEB's avatar for some reason)
558449823800623104,76,<@182974877479731201> yo_ the Moribito blacksmith episode was freaking great
558457164411306004,133,<@182974877479731201> Moribito || I like how they go against the tropes and Chagum and his brother are actually really good people ||
558458475550867496,145,Moribito || show was great in the first arc but now that it started to focus on the characters a lot more it started getting better and better ||
558459051705499665,58,thanks for recommending it_ I wasn't aware how good it was
558459059594985497,10,it's great
558760192741867531,60,you could add KnK in there to make everything more enjoyable
558762286425309196,66,cmon_ type moon ain't that complicated <:haHAA:529569462676881438>
558762317462896672,20,here's a short guide
558762336308166659,0,
558762939230847026,54,and accidentally become a lolicon after watching illya
558765171561201665,83,speaking of fate VNs and stuff_ sometimes I feel like reading VNs but decide not to
558765194747183105,23,community way too niche
558765276263612432,79,you spend so much time on them and you barely have people to talk to about them
558789989224284160,83,is this a reinterpretation or something? or no longer human has always been sci fi?
558790016596180992,17,had no idea if so
558790257596956692,44,except they function fundamentally different
558790355437223953,42,lighting abilities were invented by naruto
558791641461424132,40,take weebs for example_ they use lolirgy
558791714559492117,34,levi is adept at casting hardening
558792386411626516,4,NANA
558799513129844751,74,<@182974877479731201> Moribito || didn't know Chagum was medieval Akagi ||
558799793959469090,27,Chagum is a great character
558805651795738625,4,yeah
558806333713809408,85,Moribito episode 11 || that moment when Tanda went into Nayug was freaking awesome ||
558807802894876712,26,it was really great indeed
558827646545559562,32,man_ besides looking gorgeous af
558827713977122857,69,there's something else to moribito_ I think it's the shot composition
558827747556720650,22,there's a lot of depth
558827859192446986,87,when characters interact with the environment it really feels 3d and appropriately wide
558827892533100574,55,for example when there's a serious fight in a big field
558827981359939602,57,they do a really good job of making that field feel legit
558828689630953473,19,yeah_ it's on point
558828843130028042,9,well said
558829098072276993,81,it's a mystery why this show is so under-watched and barely talked about nowadays
558829763347742779,43,the fight 2 episodes later was also amazing
558829797464342559,58,and what made me think about this a lot in the first place
558829852061466634,51,then episode 14 was itself quite a visual spectacle
558831641271730176,59,watching this also made me hyped up for Stand Alone Complex
558831664164241418,25,which I did not watch yet
558831690055942155,24,for no particular reason
558991037196926999,47,but shieldbro has lolis so it has an edge on it
558992176466493440,51,now we can talk about the lewd magia records design
558992193289715712,55,https://shop.r10s.jp/kidsroom/cabinet/gacha11/g9549.jpg
558992286969626624,61,the outfit itself is great? but why is it in something madoka
558992765380329472,43,at least they put the YYH cast in the front
558992845038420026,45,name a better shounen protagonist than Yusuke
558992861740400651,17,protip: you can't
558993124953817089,29,kengan asura will be full cg?
558993937981898762,21,the Bleach soundtrack
558993946362249217,7,is dope
558993980558278688,26,I remember my Bleach phase
558994184086880267,61,so Kubo made some art of the characters after the manga ended
558994251913101312,68,turns out Orihime transformed into a hentai ara ara ultra thicc milf
558994304849149968,4,yeah
558994372994138115,21,she's extra thicc now
558994453592014869,39,nah_ you don't know her post manga look
558994530477539338,43,she legit looks straight out of milf hentai
558994565093392395,21,she went full ara ara
558994601336111105,14,fully disagree
558994880668631040,21,let me look it up xal
558994893071187978,15,and I'll DM you
558995047597473802,45,alright_ whoever wants to see it_ go to ecchi
558995231438274583,27,imagine not remembering Ulq
558995286379200512,31,when did you watch Bleach Reef?
558995460208066560,23,especially milf orihime
558995619042033664,17,kubo went all out
558995650411495434,43,even her choice of swimsuit is hentai level
558995968444596244,27,this lacks the ara ara look
558995995195867136,34,which makes any thicc waifu better
558996313841205259,31,reef_ when did you watch bleach
558996760882577442,22,he's trolling you mate
558996802691530764,59,your message probably got removed because you were spamming
558996822585114644,12,very quickly
558997151976390666,63,that's good_ watching it as a teen is when you get maximum hype
558997261489668106,57,I was probably around 14 when my bleach phase got serious
559005316013096980,53,masamune was nowhere near rezero levels of popularity
559005451719671818,27,High School Girls season 2?
559005598977622036,12,I was joking
559005621442052099,29,I'll have to watch HSG myselg
559005663183896576,22,for the smug main girl
559006027878498341,22,that's someone's waifu
559006064272474125,30,don't talk about her like that
559006312168423425,31,https://i.imgur.com/3x2GSDp.jpg
