558439130036437002,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,115,anybody here watched Colorful? I really liked the movie and when I looked at the score turns out everybody hated it
558439732741275662,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,338,the irony is that rape is a huge genre in doujins which are very popular among anime fans yet when it happens in a show all of a sudden everyone is like "oh noes_ why did they sexualize this_ can't handle it_ gonna faint" Edit: already finished writing this before you said move on_ so gonna leave it as my final reply_ don't kill me Beef

558457164411306004,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,133,<@182974877479731201> Moribito || I like how they go against the tropes and Chagum and his brother are actually really good people ||
558458475550867496,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,145,Moribito || show was great in the first arc but now that it started to focus on the characters a lot more it started getting better and better ||
558459051705499665,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,58,thanks for recommending it_ I wasn't aware how good it was
558459059594985497,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,10,it's great
558760192741867531,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,60,you could add KnK in there to make everything more enjoyable

558762317462896672,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,20,here's a short guide
558762336308166659,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,0,
558762939230847026,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,54,and accidentally become a lolicon after watching illya
558765171561201665,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,83,speaking of fate VNs and stuff_ sometimes I feel like reading VNs but decide not to
558765194747183105,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,23,community way too niche
558765276263612432,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,79,you spend so much time on them and you barely have people to talk to about them
558789989224284160,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,83,is this a reinterpretation or something? or no longer human has always been sci fi?
558790016596180992,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,17,had no idea if so
558790257596956692,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,44,except they function fundamentally different
558790355437223953,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,42,lighting abilities were invented by naruto
558791641461424132,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,40,take weebs for example_ they use lolirgy
558791714559492117,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,34,levi is adept at casting hardening
558792386411626516,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,4,NANA
558799513129844751,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,74,<@182974877479731201> Moribito || didn't know Chagum was medieval Akagi ||
558799793959469090,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,27,Chagum is a great character
558805651795738625,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,4,yeah
558806333713809408,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,85,Moribito episode 11 || that moment when Tanda went into Nayug was freaking awesome ||
558807802894876712,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,26,it was really great indeed
558827646545559562,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,32,man_ besides looking gorgeous af
558827713977122857,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,69,there's something else to moribito_ I think it's the shot composition
558827747556720650,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,22,there's a lot of depth
558827859192446986,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,87,when characters interact with the environment it really feels 3d and appropriately wide
558827892533100574,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,55,for example when there's a serious fight in a big field
558827981359939602,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,57,they do a really good job of making that field feel legit
558828689630953473,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,19,yeah_ it's on point
558828843130028042,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,9,well said
558829098072276993,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,81,it's a mystery why this show is so under-watched and barely talked about nowadays
558829763347742779,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,43,the fight 2 episodes later was also amazing
558829797464342559,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,58,and what made me think about this a lot in the first place
558829852061466634,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,51,then episode 14 was itself quite a visual spectacle
558831641271730176,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,59,watching this also made me hyped up for Stand Alone Complex
558831664164241418,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,25,which I did not watch yet
558831690055942155,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,24,for no particular reason
558991037196926999,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,47,but shieldbro has lolis so it has an edge on it
558992176466493440,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,51,now we can talk about the lewd magia records design
558992193289715712,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,55,https://shop.r10s.jp/kidsroom/cabinet/gacha11/g9549.jpg
558992286969626624,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,61,the outfit itself is great? but why is it in something madoka
558992765380329472,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,43,at least they put the YYH cast in the front
558992845038420026,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,45,name a better shounen protagonist than Yusuke
558992861740400651,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,17,protip: you can't

558994184086880267,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,61,so Kubo made some art of the characters after the manga ended
558994251913101312,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,68,turns out Orihime transformed into a hentai ara ara ultra thicc milf
558994304849149968,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,4,yeah

558995650411495434,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,43,even her choice of swimsuit is hentai level
558995968444596244,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,27,this lacks the ara ara look
558995995195867136,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,34,which makes any thicc waifu better
558996313841205259,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,reef_ when did you watch bleach
558996760882577442,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,22,he's trolling you mate

558997151976390666,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,63,that's good_ watching it as a teen is when you get maximum hype
558997261489668106,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,57,I was probably around 14 when my bleach phase got serious
559005316013096980,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,53,masamune was nowhere near rezero levels of popularity
559005451719671818,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,27,High School Girls season 2?

559007310098464768,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,46,also_ they need to adapt the epilogue of arc 3
559007355975630868,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,39,which they left out of the first season
559007683995500544,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,57,no point in going to another channel just to type 4 lines
559007855039086623,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,28,you know what would be great

559098068520402955,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,86,the ultimate weeb watches and enjoys every single genre <:charhaha:447488960675971073>
