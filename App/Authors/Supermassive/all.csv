561003249960878101,Minion Masters,bug_reports,312,I think there might be a minion retargeting bug that happens randomly. My minions kept retargeting to other minions even when none of them moved/other minions came in. And no_ there weren't any taunt/decoy minions. It's pretty minor but it did just stop my ghost from capturing a minion which cost me the game...
