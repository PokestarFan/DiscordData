558459584629571604,r/teenagers,debates,11,Like actual
558459624085520384,r/teenagers,debates,14,I've read Marx
558459783238254606,r/teenagers,debates,67,Yeah but ending capitalism won't automatically solve climate change
558459821917995008,r/teenagers,debates,58,<@378627967435145219> yes capital requires infinite growth
558459912875671563,r/teenagers,debates,53,Capital is literally money that accumulates on itself
558460380582641664,r/teenagers,debates,219,The long term and short term debt cycles exist sure_ but you don't see all the capital destroyed within it. Productive forces are immensely higher then they were in the 1800s_ even if we saw a few long term debt crashes
558462115376267264,r/teenagers,debates,83,The capital stock isn't destroyed in full with these crashes_ it still accumulates.
558462196086996992,r/teenagers,debates,51,<@304231068796715009> no_ markets aren't capitalism
558462269068148746,r/teenagers,debates,63,Capitalism is a totality_ a mode of production based on capital
558462694676496396,r/teenagers,debates,14,We all are tbh
558462726444417054,r/teenagers,debates,27,Varoufakis wrote about this
558462971328725110,r/teenagers,debates,79,Capital has become financialized_ not focused on real economic activity anymore

558463832180260866,r/teenagers,debates,69,<@304231068796715009> private control of the MoP isn't capitalism lol
558463905106493442,r/teenagers,debates,29,Fedualism had private control
558463931346059283,r/teenagers,debates,22,And property relations
558464419206791208,r/teenagers,debates,262,<@378627967435145219> what?NLhis claim was capitalism was based on private ownership I pointed out how other forms of production had private ownership and property relations. It didn't embody the scale of modern capitalist industry or it's expansionist nature ofc
558465028794220554,r/teenagers,debates,136,Urban burghers owned limited manufacturing and what not in late fedualism_ the plot was private to the king_ and worked on by the serfs.
