558459572264632320,debates,31,<@378627967435145219> socialist
558459584629571604,debates,11,Like actual
558459624085520384,debates,14,I've read Marx
558459783238254606,debates,67,Yeah but ending capitalism won't automatically solve climate change
558459821917995008,debates,58,<@378627967435145219> yes capital requires infinite growth
558459912875671563,debates,53,Capital is literally money that accumulates on itself
558460380582641664,debates,219,The long term and short term debt cycles exist sure_ but you don't see all the capital destroyed within it. Productive forces are immensely higher then they were in the 1800s_ even if we saw a few long term debt crashes
558462115376267264,debates,83,The capital stock isn't destroyed in full with these crashes_ it still accumulates.
558462196086996992,debates,51,<@304231068796715009> no_ markets aren't capitalism
558462269068148746,debates,63,Capitalism is a totality_ a mode of production based on capital
558462694676496396,debates,14,We all are tbh

558462971328725110,debates,79,Capital has become financialized_ not focused on real economic activity anymore

558463832180260866,debates,69,<@304231068796715009> private control of the MoP isn't capitalism lol
558463905106493442,debates,29,Fedualism had private control
558463931346059283,debates,22,And property relations
558464419206791208,debates,262,<@378627967435145219> what?NLhis claim was capitalism was based on private ownership I pointed out how other forms of production had private ownership and property relations. It didn't embody the scale of modern capitalist industry or it's expansionist nature ofc
558465028794220554,debates,136,Urban burghers owned limited manufacturing and what not in late fedualism_ the plot was private to the king_ and worked on by the serfs.
