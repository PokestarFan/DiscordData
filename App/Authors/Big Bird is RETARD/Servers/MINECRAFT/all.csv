558465802630594570,minecraft,517,Hey look buddy_ I'm an engineer. That means I solve problems_ not problems like "What is beauty?" Because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems_ for instance: how am I going to stop some mean mother Hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous be-hind? The answer_ use a gun_ and if that don't work... Use more gun. Take for instance this heavy caliber tripod mounted lil' old number designed by me_ built by me_ and you best hope... Not pointed at you.
