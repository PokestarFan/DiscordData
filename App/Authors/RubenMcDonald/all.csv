She was LITERALLY born into the  industry_ and grew up in an area of LA where people like Skrillex and Beck came from. Her brother is a fucking professional music producer yet people still want to sit around and talk about how fucking smart and talented she is holy shit man. "uhhh buh her voic is so good!" yeah maybe if you're a fucking dipshit teenage girl that started learning how to sing from taking choir freshman year of high school but obviously her voice is going to be good. Listen fuckhead_ imagine you're born into LA_ you're entire family works in the music industry_ you're parents put you in the fucking LA Children's Choir when you're 8 years old_ and you sing for literally you're entire stupid fucking dipshit wannabe depressed life_ obviously you're going to be able to sing very quietly and do falsetto pretty well by the time you're 16 and your fucking MUSIC PRODUCER BROTHER is helping you write music. But that's not even the worst part of Billie Eyelash_ her stupid fucking wannabe depressed attitude.
559052499013599262,r/teenagers,general,947,Look_ I get it_ she's 16_ she doesn't understand her emotions yet. But If she's 16 and want to express her emotion_ learn how to express it in a way that isnt the most fucking vapid emotionless shit on the planet. One of my favorite bands is Radiohead_ and Thom Yorke has a quote where_ in regards to their music being sad_ he talks about how it's not about the music being sad_ it's about using that emotion as inspiration to make something good. Billie Eilish is homeschooled and hangs out with celebrities every fuckin day_ but all she can manage to do with her emotion is by basically bragging about being depressed 24/7 like it's some cool shit. Is there anything more annoying than those fucking idiot chicks you knew in highschool that would talk about being sad all the time? Then why the fuck are you imbicils actually supporting this dipshit that just brags about being sad all the time. Jesus christ I hate Bully Goolash so fucking bad.
