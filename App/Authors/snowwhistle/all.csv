558436606353342494,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,30,I prefer Nadia to Eva_ mostly.
558436662351364209,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,45,I still need to see Anno's other work though.
558436793712771082,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,114,Hot take... I don't think the Island arc is quite as bad (sans 3 or 4 specific episodes) as most people say it is.
558436950848045057,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,142,Anno didn't leave Nadia. He was so busy working on the final five episodes that he had to leave episodes 23-34 with his friend Shinji Higuchi.
558437342356963328,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,45,I will defend episode 30 and 31 to the grave.
558437598998167602,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,182,Also_ despite the Island arc being a big mess there's little scenes in it that I did like. I could see the Island Arc being reedited into 3 or 4 episodes and being a serviceable arc.
558437926791544832,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,121,I've only ever seen the anime film version of GITS_ but I thought it had some fascinating ideas outside of transhumanism.
558438477595672602,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,108,Goblin Slayer is fine. It's nothing special_ but I found it entertaining isekai trash with some funny lines.
558438702339194890,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,17,Whoops. It's not.
558438788926537753,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,115,I've just begun to associate all fantasy anime with isekai because 90% of the time now if it's fantasy it's isekai.
558438914193620995,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,65,(not all fantasy_ the European dungeons-and-dragons type fantasy)
558440029375037471,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,4,Same
558440148262715402,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,67,Lets hope it gets a good season 2 and not a One Punch Man season 2.
558440921071616042,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,69,I mean_ we technically don't. But that was a VERY concerning trailer.
558831823812034560,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,85,Heads up to anyone interested. Evangelion is premiering on Netflix in like 3 minutes.
558832715147771904,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,70,Oh is it an announcement? I thought they were gonna stream an episode.
558832750078197769,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,11,On YouTube.
558833119151521803,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,20,God damn it Netflix.
558833139556810754,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,18,That's not Spring.
558833632576405514,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,6,きもちわるい
558834121841967105,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,103,Only young Japanese teenage boys_ and occasionally Japanese virgin men in their 20s get to be isekai'd.
