558870840167497749,events,611,Hey everyone!NLQuick update on the March Madness tournament as we wrap up the round of 64. Currently the top 5 are neck-and-neck!NLNL1) posteryno - 148 pointsNL2) Thewildpig - 132 pointsNL3) snowmaninblack3400 - 130 pointsNL4) IAmChaozz - 129 pointsNL5) PMMEYOURRADISH - 128 pointsNLNLScoring weights have been adjusted a bit_ since the current weights prevent any first-round success from making a difference in later ones.NLNLFor those not in the pool_ every correct pick earns points equal to the seed number times the round weight_ which increases each successive round.NLNLGood luck everyone_ and may the best teen win!
