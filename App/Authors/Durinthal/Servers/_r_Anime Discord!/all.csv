558439633655037966,anime,110,I'm tempted to watch Interstella again based solely on seeing the characters in <#268515018897620995> just now
558441354729095175,anime,29,time for more Suite Precure ðŸŽµ
558441875770703882,anime,70,aren't most of them fairly similar_ at least when seen from the front?
558441962001399810,anime,44,or maybe not <:akkothonk:529569460743569430>
558442039931437067,anime,66,Ichika's shortest_ Yotsuba's still not even shoulder length right?
558442180960845844,anime,61,other three would be fairly similar if not styled differently
558443136490405888,anime,101,I'm gonna be sad when every other Precure fails to live up to the first two non-airing ones I watched
558443922918211598,anime,36,still just later this year right now
558444149041397784,anime,89,maybe summer_ more likely fall if I had to guess since it still hasn't been announced yet
558445213190717461,anime,46,is the first one even available and subbed yet
558445685775663106,anime,22,not on AB yet at least
558446212307746837,anime,31,here works_ or post on /r/anime
558446270893785109,anime,41,I think /r/animesuggest handles those too
558446533075271690,anime,13,from twitter?
558446804065058826,anime,23,Assassination Classroom
558446830753415178,anime,18,going by trace.moe
558447321591840778,anime,69,if you have an unaltered screenshot and it's in their DB_ pretty well
558447454698078238,anime,19,it's fuzzy matching
558447688270479385,anime,247,"The image search algorithm is designed for almost-exact match_ not similar match. It analyze the color layout of the image. So_ when your image is not a full un-cropped original 16:9 screenshot (i.e. cropped image)_ the search would likely fail."

558448142979432450,anime,28,I really should rewatch that
558448190697766914,anime,33,it's been 5.5 years at this point
558448370226823169,anime,25,not enough CGI for Nodame
558454481008721932,anime,31,that's how I am with most shows
558454524260515860,anime,40,it's rare that I want to binge something
558455375741845505,anime,26,oh yeah that was a fun one
558458927226945537,anime,12,that's a lot
558459113563226134,anime,43,now you can move on to ~~Boruto~~ One Piece
558459430790889483,anime,66,as long as you're enjoying them <:jojothumbsup:529569462131884035>
558459568623976480,anime,50,I still haven't seen most of the big shounen anime
558462232090902538,anime,102,Suite has a solid OST tooNLhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBTXo7oj7dQ&list=PL93453A14F709C072&index=28
558754906077397022,anime,31,it was in US theaters last week
558754938986037269,anime,38,there's a camrip available online IIRC
558755256151048195,anime,43,<:yuishrug:529569462207250433> it's on nyaa
558755344088694794,anime,33,we don't care about piracy here â˜ 
558755538339364864,anime,9,good idea
558755674394460171,anime,94,now you're gonna have me thinking about a full Fate franchise rewatch on my way home from work
558755936810958848,anime,31,it's definitely not a good idea
558755987100532748,anime,32,I hate myself for considering it
558756273160454164,anime,112,too bad HF doesn't fit at the end by any means_ otherwise it could be fun leading up to its release/availability
558756443013251073,anime,39,I haven't seen Last Encore or Illya yet
558756813550518272,anime,72,also soon to have multiple FGO anime to fit in <:LUL:529569462752641034>
558756903920861214,anime,14,Fate/Apocrypha
558756930915532813,anime,26,with the best abbreviation
558756983830872098,anime,15,most of Fate is
558757878748676106,anime,26,if only there was an anime
558757953486716944,anime,39,IIRC that's the spinoff set in America?
558758080645693456,anime,42,don't remember if it's a separate timeline
558758327018979339,anime,130,IIRC the main canon is Zero -> Stay Night (all of it) -> Hollow Ataraxia -> Grand OrderNLbut I don't remember where I got that from
558758954620944389,anime,59,Apocrypha timeline doesn't have Zero and the rest happening
558759075752574978,anime,53,though its servant concepts are utilized for FGO_ yes
558759413117353986,anime,30,<:yuishrug:529569462207250433>
558759491261300736,anime,11,that's fair
558759599063302184,anime,65,there's a youtube edit of Deen's that tries to stick to the route
558759666306252802,anime,40,but I wouldn't try that with the rewatch
558759850046128148,anime,59,I still think I'd go UBW first_ make Zero the prequel it is
558759912331804718,anime,77,Fate route isn't that necessary_ it's mostly an introduction to the franchise
558759957865168896,anime,74,Saber gets shafted somewhat as a result but <:yuishrug:529569462207250433>
558760203026432009,anime,50,probably_ it's been too long since I've watched it
558760330327752734,anime,45,have a single KnK movie after every Fate show
558760365887062034,anime,34,in release order because of course
558760902183092239,anime,32,Tsukihime remake into Carnival 2
558761068214616067,anime,23,it's my second favorite
558761108802895875,anime,15,best is cooking
558761399233544242,anime,31,I now kinda want to watch Illya
558761548395315200,anime,68,maybe next year if I'm gonna go ahead with a magical girl theme then
558761627097497600,anime,14,I have no idea
558761905297031168,anime,10,yuri bait?
558762010289111040,anime,52,what if I don't want to watch it for the yuri though
558762062709260289,anime,35,I know that seems like a weird idea
558762517422145536,anime,96,honestly the top part is all you needNL"So you want to watch Fate/Stay Night"NL"Protip: **don't**"
558762864014393345,anime,68,should include a Melty Blood tournament in the middle of the rewatch
558763384447827968,anime,31,I forgot how old that chart was
558763411236847616,anime,34,before even the UBW anime came out
558826948629889024,anime,88,I'm three days behind but the most recent episode of 3D Kanojo <:wtf:452887335730806786>
558827008503578624,anime,73,not that anyone else is watching it_ which is why I was fine with waiting
558828973400915978,recommendations,66,I like Nana more than the other two <:yuishrug:529569462207250433>

558832463590195228,anime,28,come be disappointed with me
558832584902311957,anime,35,it's a countdown to an announcement
558832691550748673,anime,165,`Because you demanded it_ today you will finally learn the Netflix debut date of your all-time favorite anime_ Neon Genesis Evangelion. All happening at 7.00 PM PT.`

558840735672041504,anime,63,what if it's based on LN though <:akkothonk:529569460743569430>
558840847953559582,anime,38,but can I judge it by the book's cover
558842017757659146,anime,4,nope
558842261375418379,anime,51,mr. "totally not using a bot to post there" strider

558842748820520986,anime,48,I honestly have no idea_ but suspicious at least
558843357774741535,anime,15,generally agree
558843397230690315,anime,61,would be nice if it wasn't mostly coming from one user though
558844397261815816,anime,79,I know who you're talking about but it makes me laugh when taken out of context
558845862776799251,anime,41,now to wait for the triple audio releases
558845936017604608,anime,30,<:yuishrug:529569462207250433>

558847623247953951,anime,88,I have no idea how I'm going to rate Domestic Girlfriend <:akkothonk:529569460743569430>
558847765837250560,anime,39,I don't think it's good_ but it's *fun*
558847964806643723,anime,27,it might be NGE tier for me
558848021710766080,anime,58,which means I don't rate it <:charhaha:447488960675971073>
