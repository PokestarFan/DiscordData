558439633655037966,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,110,I'm tempted to watch Interstella again based solely on seeing the characters in <#268515018897620995> just now
558441354729095175,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,29,time for more Suite Precure ðŸŽµ
558441875770703882,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,70,aren't most of them fairly similar_ at least when seen from the front?
558441962001399810,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,44,or maybe not <:akkothonk:529569460743569430>
558442039931437067,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,66,Ichika's shortest_ Yotsuba's still not even shoulder length right?
558442180960845844,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,61,other three would be fairly similar if not styled differently
558443136490405888,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,101,I'm gonna be sad when every other Precure fails to live up to the first two non-airing ones I watched
558443922918211598,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,36,still just later this year right now
558444149041397784,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,89,maybe summer_ more likely fall if I had to guess since it still hasn't been announced yet
558445213190717461,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,46,is the first one even available and subbed yet
558445685775663106,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,22,not on AB yet at least
558446212307746837,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,here works_ or post on /r/anime
558446270893785109,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,41,I think /r/animesuggest handles those too
558446533075271690,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,13,from twitter?

558447321591840778,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,69,if you have an unaltered screenshot and it's in their DB_ pretty well
558447454698078238,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,19,it's fuzzy matching
558447688270479385,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,247,"The image search algorithm is designed for almost-exact match_ not similar match. It analyze the color layout of the image. So_ when your image is not a full un-cropped original 16:9 screenshot (i.e. cropped image)_ the search would likely fail."

558448142979432450,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,28,I really should rewatch that
558448190697766914,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,33,it's been 5.5 years at this point
558448370226823169,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,25,not enough CGI for Nodame
558454481008721932,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,that's how I am with most shows
558454524260515860,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,40,it's rare that I want to binge something
558455375741845505,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,26,oh yeah that was a fun one
558458927226945537,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,12,that's a lot
558459113563226134,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,43,now you can move on to ~~Boruto~~ One Piece
558459430790889483,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,66,as long as you're enjoying them <:jojothumbsup:529569462131884035>
558459568623976480,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,50,I still haven't seen most of the big shounen anime
558462232090902538,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,102,Suite has a solid OST tooNLhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBTXo7oj7dQ&list=PL93453A14F709C072&index=28
558754906077397022,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,it was in US theaters last week
558754938986037269,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,38,there's a camrip available online IIRC
558755256151048195,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,43,<:yuishrug:529569462207250433> it's on nyaa
558755344088694794,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,33,we don't care about piracy here â˜ 
558755538339364864,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,9,good idea
558755674394460171,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,94,now you're gonna have me thinking about a full Fate franchise rewatch on my way home from work
558755936810958848,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,it's definitely not a good idea
558755987100532748,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,32,I hate myself for considering it
558756273160454164,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,112,too bad HF doesn't fit at the end by any means_ otherwise it could be fun leading up to its release/availability
558756443013251073,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,39,I haven't seen Last Encore or Illya yet
558756813550518272,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,72,also soon to have multiple FGO anime to fit in <:LUL:529569462752641034>
558756903920861214,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,14,Fate/Apocrypha
558756930915532813,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,26,with the best abbreviation
558756983830872098,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,15,most of Fate is
558757878748676106,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,26,if only there was an anime
558757953486716944,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,39,IIRC that's the spinoff set in America?
558758080645693456,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,42,don't remember if it's a separate timeline
558758327018979339,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,130,IIRC the main canon is Zero -> Stay Night (all of it) -> Hollow Ataraxia -> Grand OrderNLbut I don't remember where I got that from
558758954620944389,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,59,Apocrypha timeline doesn't have Zero and the rest happening
558759075752574978,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,53,though its servant concepts are utilized for FGO_ yes
558759413117353986,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,30,<:yuishrug:529569462207250433>
558759491261300736,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,11,that's fair
558759599063302184,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,65,there's a youtube edit of Deen's that tries to stick to the route
558759666306252802,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,40,but I wouldn't try that with the rewatch
558759850046128148,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,59,I still think I'd go UBW first_ make Zero the prequel it is
558759912331804718,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,77,Fate route isn't that necessary_ it's mostly an introduction to the franchise
558759957865168896,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,74,Saber gets shafted somewhat as a result but <:yuishrug:529569462207250433>
558760203026432009,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,50,probably_ it's been too long since I've watched it
558760330327752734,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,45,have a single KnK movie after every Fate show
558760365887062034,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,34,in release order because of course
558760902183092239,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,32,Tsukihime remake into Carnival 2
558761068214616067,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,23,it's my second favorite
558761108802895875,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,15,best is cooking
558761399233544242,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,I now kinda want to watch Illya
558761548395315200,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,68,maybe next year if I'm gonna go ahead with a magical girl theme then
558761627097497600,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,14,I have no idea
558761905297031168,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,10,yuri bait?
558762010289111040,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,52,what if I don't want to watch it for the yuri though
558762062709260289,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,35,I know that seems like a weird idea
558762517422145536,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,96,honestly the top part is all you needNL"So you want to watch Fate/Stay Night"NL"Protip: **don't**"
558762864014393345,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,68,should include a Melty Blood tournament in the middle of the rewatch
558763384447827968,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,I forgot how old that chart was
558763411236847616,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,34,before even the UBW anime came out
558826948629889024,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,88,I'm three days behind but the most recent episode of 3D Kanojo <:wtf:452887335730806786>
558827008503578624,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,73,not that anyone else is watching it_ which is why I was fine with waiting
558828973400915978,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,66,I like Nana more than the other two <:yuishrug:529569462207250433>
