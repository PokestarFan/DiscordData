558464617085665280,serious-personal,52,or at least try to find out exactl what made her run
558465198931968026,serious-personal,8,metallum
558465228027723816,serious-personal,39,she could be too pressured cause of the
558465284235591682,serious-personal,50,fact that it's kind forbidden your relationship???
558465300559953920,serious-personal,27,idk if that makes sense but

558465372798582794,serious-personal,54,try asking her if she wants to be in this relationship
558465448463695911,serious-personal,24,ask her to be honest too
558465993643655190,serious-personal,53,sometimes people say things in the heat of the moment

558467701429764128,serious-personal,68,she might be breaking under the pressure of having to keep it secret
558467775350308864,serious-personal,48,but she might not want to actually part with you
558467899728330752,serious-personal,104,i dont mean to sound like a bitch but you need to talk to her and find out if this is what she's feeling
558467962097631262,serious-personal,60,because if you hate keeping it a secret_ she probably is too
