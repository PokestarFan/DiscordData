558870111860293632,106,I feel like learning to code in college is kind of shit. You're basically on your own to actually learn it
558870327200055307,13,It's not free
558870386402394123,62,Also teachers have limited time. They cannot TEACH you to code

558871022246297631,57,Depends on the professor how much time they have to give.
558871069721886761,59,Some have multiple classes and may work outside of college.
558871261552312351,62,<@202170365361913856> That depends on the school and the class
558871402891968512,131,Like I have had some teachers that were in their field for many years and they want to give back to the college so they teach there
