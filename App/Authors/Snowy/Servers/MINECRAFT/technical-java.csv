558864397662158858,249,(this is in 1.13.2 and i have no mods loaded) whenever i try to go into a realm server for minecraft it either doesnt let me in an says 'disconnected' or lets me in for like 3 seconds and then says 'disconnected' anyone got ideas on how to fix this?
558864804345806848,103,i dont have any other realm servers but yes i have tried other multiplayer servers and they have worked
558864846150565908,46,also i was able to play on the realm yesterday
558864868187570177,28,but today it stopped working
558864921669140480,52,and my friends can join the realm aswell just not me
558865102879850527,112,i also have pretty bad internet (20kb a second) and ive restarted the router twice and my computer and minecraft
558865371998978048,70,it was the same as that yesterday though_ its just really confusing me
