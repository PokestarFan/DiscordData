My phone may be 2.5 years old and I bought it brand-new for less than $300 (great discount)_ but using custom software really helped. I'll show the difference before and after image processing in a second.NLNLBad lighting really ruins photos_ especially with phones. Small cameras like the ones used in phones just can't squeeze out enough light of the tiny sensor it used. Only with plenty of daylight the photos will look this good. This photo was taken in front of a window

560602128775643137,self,89,But once it gets dark or you start zooming in_ well it gets bad pretty quickly I must say
560602421877800961,self,63,Ahh that probably explains a lot. Smartphones are evolving fast
