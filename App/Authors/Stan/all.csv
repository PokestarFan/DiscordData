560600700468461583,r/teenagers,self,559,<@286587365235884032> Thanks haha_ it's all about two things: lighting and software. My phone may be 2.5 years old and I bought it brand-new for less than $300 (great discount)_ but using custom software really helped. I'll show the difference before and after image processing in a second.NLNLBad lighting really ruins photos_ especially with phones. Small cameras like the ones used in phones just can't squeeze out enough light of the tiny sensor it used. Only with plenty of daylight the photos will look this good. This photo was taken in front of a window
