558865173817982987,Official Fortnite,battle-royale,218,if ur running some specific settings that u wanna stick with u can just have it on read and write_ set everything up in game_ close the game and change it to read only_ then u will always load in with the same settings
558865732172120072,Official Fortnite,battle-royale,211,<@279654208012156929> what shouldnt matter? one upside of having it read only is if u accidentally make ur game windowed or so_ then u just need to restart it_ rather than to change all the resolutions etc again
