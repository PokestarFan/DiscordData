561001045535490058,18,Cuz it's free info
561001106436653066,34,player's handbook is a bought book
561001164439552011,43,There's only a couple that have public info

561009456130031626,12,thing is tho
561009487365013506,33,Some people on the party had 2 HP
561009524706770952,40,And cuz melee combat does 1/4 dmg lethal
561009553412718604,30,An 8 dmg punch would kill them
561009739874435092,26,yeh 2e is death apparently
561009767896711168,45,And he's not giving them new characters afaik
561009792014090280,43,so if they die they're out for the campaign
