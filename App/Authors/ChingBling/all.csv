560609556678443028,MINECRAFT,minecraft,16,caves are boring
560609590165766144,MINECRAFT,minecraft,46,they need to have some s p i c e added to them
560609730888859669,MINECRAFT,minecraft,98,caves need some spicyness added to them to make it so that they aren't so uninteresting to explore
560610009122209792,MINECRAFT,minecraft,196,i don't even want new ores_ just some variation in blocks in the caves would be nice_ and new underground structures similar to (don't kill me) Terraria would definitely make caving less of a slog
