560609213491970051,78,i want to start a new modded playthrough but i can't think of what mods to add
560609300289159178,16,caves please god
560609369323208746,32,caves are so fucking b o r i n g
560609556678443028,16,caves are boring
560609590165766144,46,they need to have some s p i c e added to them
560609730888859669,98,caves need some spicyness added to them to make it so that they aren't so uninteresting to explore
560610009122209792,196,i don't even want new ores_ just some variation in blocks in the caves would be nice_ and new underground structures similar to (don't kill me) Terraria would definitely make caving less of a slog
560610239955861524,88,basically it makes crafting banners not the worst thing in the world to try and remember
