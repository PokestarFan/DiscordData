560609213491970051,minecraft,78,i want to start a new modded playthrough but i can't think of what mods to add
560609300289159178,minecraft,16,caves please god
560609369323208746,minecraft,32,caves are so fucking b o r i n g
560609556678443028,minecraft,16,caves are boring
560609590165766144,minecraft,46,they need to have some s p i c e added to them
560609730888859669,minecraft,98,caves need some spicyness added to them to make it so that they aren't so uninteresting to explore
560610009122209792,minecraft,196,i don't even want new ores_ just some variation in blocks in the caves would be nice_ and new underground structures similar to (don't kill me) Terraria would definitely make caving less of a slog
560610239955861524,minecraft,88,basically it makes crafting banners not the worst thing in the world to try and remember
560637972223885315,minecraft,42,i mean it's pretty obvious why it happened
560637997804945449,minecraft,16,is it right? no.
