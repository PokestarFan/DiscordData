558461728791199758,37,hey guys is now a good time to spill?
558463896919343114,1458,Okay_ so long story short_ my ex and I got back together secretly_ my parents don't like her because her mom is a legit liar. I don't have a car yet but she has her classes in town when I'm at home at that time so we decided on her way back from classes I would "take a walk" and we would meet up. We've been talking for about a month again I've known her for 4 years total. Anyway so we get to walking_ holding hands and talking to each other. I live near a river so we decided to walk down to it lots of houses but it's all in a forested area. We get there are relive the old times when we kayaked and what not_ sat down on the riverbank and just cuddle/held each other. We talked and talked and this went on for a half hour then my dad (who is at work) calls me and asks me where I'm at because my mom is freaking out on him because I took longer then my usual 20 minutes on a walk. I tell my dad I'm getting home_ we start walking up the stairs that lead up from the river and on one of the landings I take both her hands in mine and face her (context we've only ever kissed once like a year ago before we split up legit on the same day and it was rushed) so I ask her "Think I can make up for that kiss on that friday forever ago" and she legit says "I can't" and bolts up the stairs. I had to get home so I run back home and get on with life. I haven't contacted her yet_ I think I know what I'm going to say to her but I honestly don't know how I feel
558464160019644424,268,she has since texted me "I am so so sorry I feel horrible about running I just got really scared and my head was getting to me so muchNLIm so.. so sorry..NLYou didnâ€™t deserve thatNLYou were so sweet and I let my head get to meNLchloejeanneToday at 7:06 PMNL..Are you ok? ðŸ˜•"
558464373660581908,73,<@548730525184032768> that could be it but honestly I don't freaking know
558464399631974419,26,she acted like it was more
558464660194459651,89,we only get to see each other about once a month and never get to be alone at those times
558464766390304768,66,we've texted everyday for about a month since we got back together
558465538620260361,114,shes repeated told me she has_ I will talk to her though at least over text of discord if meeting up might be hard
558465693201465355,144,literally we got back together and said "this time we aren't going to worry about plans or the future_ or anything_ and be open with each other"
558465848377999371,131,I would rather do it in person but the only way to do that is if we meet up and that's pretty hard with my parents and her schedule
558465962693623821,111,I've kept this 100% hidden from them because they think she's really bad for me and her mom is an outright liar
558466187328225312,105,we live out of town and the only way for us to meet up is if she drives to me on her way back from places
558466334552358922,112,also my mom freaked out today because I took such a long walk and is threatening to not let me take them anymore
558466348854935554,22,things are such a mess
558466589653991445,15,over bearing af
558466608515776524,9,she is...
558466617751765024,13,I know she is
558466732532957185,66,and I hate hiding it but it's either it's hidden or nothing at all
558467334734348289,307,it's fine_ am actually not asian but family is very religious (as am I) roman catholic. My parents literally told me they just don't want things to turn out badly for me the first time they found out about her_ and since my parents know her mom and her mom is psycho they don't want me to be with her at all
558467498815520778,14,yea you get it
558467734275358721,23,See I'd agree with that
558467769734135819,24,that's a very good point
558467829989638164,38,dude that sounds exactly like the case
558467970800549898,101,like it hurt so much the first time it all fell apart but this time I don't think I'll be heartbroken
558468249319374848,128,you're so right_ I don't want to message her just yet because I think she probably needs some space to think about us/today also
558468541712433159,153,I'm not afraid to ask her this stuff_ I told her when we started everything again that this time I'm not going to be shy or stammer if something comes up
558468929899462708,190,ouch that really sucks day_ I know a guy who everyone thinks hes gay (he walks the walk and does the talk) but it's just because his dad isn't really in his life and he gets a really bad rep
558469021599662108,61,he doesn't help himself by doing ANY of the things he's doing
558469120300154880,52,and when his brothers call him gay he's like "why?!*
558469238214623234,25,yeah that is super stupid
558469334096150528,72,it's really healthy to have girls you can hang with/talk to like sisters
558469436294823946,30,ouch dude that hurts I'm sorry
558469486727135273,52,that's awesome that you have a sibling there for you
558469550488682517,51,my brothers and I have been growing apart this year
558469565932371989,22,it makes me really sad
558469690062798859,78,yeah new people can never really replace someone you've known your entire life
558469884456206346,87,I'm popping out_ I love you guys so much and hope things all get better and stay better
558469902625931274,5,peace
560624975879602187,13,thats selfish
560624995706077234,6,of him
