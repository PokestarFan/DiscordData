560601844850622484,62,It's rare_ but it is possible to find three mushrooms in there
560601864748531714,39,99% of the time there is nothing though
560608001539702800,83,Usually there should be more dialogue when you enter the ship but there wasn't much

560608437004795915,20,Nah just you I think
560608471037247508,211,The direct quote from the Reddit post is "The last thing you collected_ either via craft or pickup in the world_ or harvested before you finish the activity is what it will delete. Please approach with caution!"
560608637714694154,83,I dropped all my brick_ smashed a rock_ then collected the treasure just to be safe

560609909566078996,36,It's possible if you try hard enough
560609940897529876,20,Can you replace one?
560610058971512860,59,You can try doing an encampments mission too when it's done
560610159806644255,116,It won't be 300 though_ but if you can convince others to farm the last encampment_ you might be able to pull it off
560622453026455562,51,Because it's coming in the content update next week
560622637332692993,32,<:tomatohead:514860925547970573>

560625281896022016,112,I won't lie though_ when I first saw the quest_ I thought the same thing_ but then I knew it probably wasn't it.

560651758418788353,142,After the Yarrr! quest_ you can go back to it and it looks like a regular mission_ but it's accessible only because a quest takes place there.
560651802475888671,71,Only other time you can visit is later on in the story for other things
