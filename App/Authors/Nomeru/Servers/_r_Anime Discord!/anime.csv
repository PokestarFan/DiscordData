558433743040151554,30,these are my favorites for now
558434196016726017,49,Reek changes his name whenever people misspell it
558434723962028032,49,Reef who are you and what have you done with Road
558434804509573123,27,SSY is great on rewatch too
558434826294657031,27,pretty different experience
558435981313835019,152,Should I just continue votoms_ or start another thing now that I finished digimon? Other things I have to start next are lupin pt2_ karekano_ digimon 02
558436279679844372,4,nice
558436529077223425,81,think I'm about at the end of the votoms vietnam arc though I don't know for sure
558436644290822144,139,oh roak you missed when I figured those out kinda. well by figured out I mean I decided to ignore the bottom number as worthless info to me
558448699534213130,85,Hm_ heard (between 2 guys) "Omae wo aishiteita"_ subs say "you are my dearest friend"
558448750394343434,60,when I hear aishiteiru_ that seems like more than friendship
558449246487969804,54,yeah_ wasn't sure if it was ever used as anything else
558449360363323392,72,from votoms_ scene in question. spoilers. <https://streamable.com/bmo32>
558449463710973972,71,I feel like I need to rewatch their interactions now_ with that in mind
558450722782576650,85,rewatching their scenes I guess it seems obvious_ I just didn't think about it before
558450729933733888,9,kinda sad
558450923236622339,108,votoms ||they were in love_ torn apart by war_ and ended up in a fight to the death_ one killing the other||
558451872898351124,145,yeah <#269247167019876352> would be the place to post that and discuss it. that said I'm sure there's people here that can give some useful input
558452358544097292,113,well you brought it to people's attention here. If there are people interested in helping they can go over therre
558453609034022932,84,I like votoms quite a bit but find myself watching it more slowly than anything else
558453740957466670,61,often after 1 ep I'm satisfied_ and move on to something else
558453802286579722,19,maybe 2-3 sometimes
558472976480075778,3,hmm
558473290994417664,19,hi home_ I'm Nomeru
558473378525216803,4,nice
558756499103547443,50,fapo -> f/z -> encore -> ubw -> fgo -> illya -> hf
558756514228076548,20,there_ hf at the end
558756700572614656,11,forgot deen
558756901995806731,14,fate apocrypha
558757078429204481,70,remove spinoffs and you're just left with ubw and hf I think_ and deen
558757112113528842,49,maybe h/z depending on how loosely you count that
558759257714196515,90,I kinda think only way I'll ever watch anything past zero is if they adapt the first route
558759350873751556,30,and that seems pretty unlikely
558759432364752917,32,I've just kinda given up on fate
558764457375825934,28,mob s2 has been really great
558764519246266399,14,better than s1
558764594810585138,38,hopefully we'll have s3 announced soon
558764656525705222,53,or if there's not enough content a movie or something
558764693901148195,28,they can't not finish it now
558783541434122242,25,only anime staff position
558783585348354098,38,no one else listed as character design
558783825170268173,43,that person didn't work on the manga though
558783839363792897,9,ann lists
558784001356201994,54,then isn't listed as working on whatever the source is
558784056897306636,56,that is the only relating credit they have_ which is odd
558784523660165140,51,Also not clear what original character design means
558784589053820928,110,does that mean they did character design for the novels_ or they did character design for new anime characters
558784818792628224,22,might be up in the air
558784859502280725,33,says still publishing on mal also
558785017682067467,24,when did the author die?
558785180161277953,19,oh 10 years ago huh
558785332666171393,65,wikipedia shows 130 volumes with nothing released since 2009_ idk
558785620332380160,209,```A record 100 volumes were originally planned_[3] but the final total stands at 130 volumes and 22 side-story novels_ with the last four volumes and the twenty-second side novel published posthumously.[4]```
558785693313138690,44,so they did release 5 volumes after she died
558785731380641822,22,sounds pretty done now
558785801228648463,6,or not
558785843502907392,248,```The main story of Guin Saga resumed on November 8_ 2013_ four years after the passing of the original author. YÅ« Godai published Volume 131 Parro no Ankoku on that date_ followed by Yume Yohino's Volume 132 Cylon no Banka in December 2013.[9]```
558786158302330900,81,really interesting how they say they started out planning on it being 100 volumes
558786179462463489,25,how do you plan for that?
558792467416219664,34,levi watch any more votoms lately?
558792529525473282,36,I'm at 29 now_ it's been pretty good
558792565835694080,37,though 28 was a recap for some reason
558792788653768708,94,votoms ||yeah she was useless there_ I hear in the 3rd part where I am now she really shines||
558792830600871936,20,Chirico is great too
558793320890105866,21,that didn't bother me
558793411965091842,43,doesn't seem like that will continue though
558793780036239396,2,no
558793933103038476,69,They are the most realistic mecha designs_ for whatever that's worth.
558793981152985098,48,they're like 4 meters tall_ like a personal tank
558794100648706079,110,bipedal though they use wheels on their feet more often than actually walking it seems. or at least like 50/50
558848008456896523,27,I might give domekano a 6-7
558848119974920202,4,fix?
558848157622992896,34,also what_ I haven't seen any tits
558848289525727257,45,I did see some mention of an uncensored thing
558848383360696370,19,I haven't seen this
558848390373572619,3,dm?
558848698168246293,27,I haven't seen anything yet
558848737732984867,19,but now I'm curious
558848899675062283,30,oh those screenshots look nice
558849006780809226,31,ricey it wasn't really censored
558849048355012617,51,this uh looks like they're adding more to it though
558850861451968532,2,no
558851349890990105,39,the only fox boy that matters is kurama
558851783645200385,37,I guess it's not about hotness for me
558851855568863233,44,I bet kurama would kick that other fox's ass
558852176764600340,7,naruto?
558852331341348874,0,
558852346101104675,13,yu yu hakusho
558852517493211168,9,hahaha no
558852562732974095,30,I said fox boy_ not actual fox
558853299353419777,25,never seen any fairy tail
558853398405971988,99,heard years ago it was a one piece ripoff though that shouldn't really be a problem since I like OP
558853526047162380,31,I don't really plan on watching
558853874287509505,84,you know what I find really weird today_ <#495730922063265822> has been dead all day
558853925894225962,59,server isn't dead_ people watched and commented on domekano
558853963085250591,4,nope
558853998728445963,50,maybe unpopular fight but it went well_ still good
558854449276125195,29,that's more info than we need
558854577688936478,38,no_ please don't share like that again
558865835788206090,28,everyone should watch rakugo
558865862598066186,36,continue recommending it to everyone
559099594944806938,33,<:goodmorning:529630084764794888>
559100360325726250,39,I haven't been a big fan of any sao arc
559100482984083471,46,s3 is going uh fine though? it's not the worst
560949562857226280,11,no spoilers
560949577247621140,29,idk what you're talking about
560949610009591838,18,just uh a reminder
560949795972186122,34,we have a channel for that I think
560949890394619911,41,<#529794935885529098> I think is the same
560985096837136394,169,I was surprised when this came up in lupin and have no idea why now that I've thought about it_ it can't be a new thing to be confused about https://streamable.com/v6zxc
560985884455862276,18,comes down to this
560986145073397771,44,the joke is that everyone doesn't understand
560986160235544590,12,except lupin
560986222630273034,47,they're both 1kg_ so of course they're the same
560986571931648009,27,all different staff from s1
560986700520751104,17,no don't think so
560986764060393492,16,cj staff I think
560986860885901336,4,yeah
560995893248131073,71,what is wrong with eurobeat? or is <#529795306275995678> being spammed?
561000865327218689,4,nice
561001229627424771,8,ah movie
561001255271661608,30,did you already watch/read it?
