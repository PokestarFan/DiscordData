558435981313835019,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,152,Should I just continue votoms_ or start another thing now that I finished digimon? Other things I have to start next are lupin pt2_ karekano_ digimon 02
558436279679844372,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,4,nice
558436529077223425,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,81,think I'm about at the end of the votoms vietnam arc though I don't know for sure
558436644290822144,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,139,oh roak you missed when I figured those out kinda. well by figured out I mean I decided to ignore the bottom number as worthless info to me
558448699534213130,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,85,Hm_ heard (between 2 guys) "Omae wo aishiteita"_ subs say "you are my dearest friend"
558448750394343434,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,60,when I hear aishiteiru_ that seems like more than friendship
558449246487969804,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,54,yeah_ wasn't sure if it was ever used as anything else
558449360363323392,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,72,from votoms_ scene in question. spoilers. <https://streamable.com/bmo32>
558449463710973972,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,71,I feel like I need to rewatch their interactions now_ with that in mind
558450722782576650,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,85,rewatching their scenes I guess it seems obvious_ I just didn't think about it before
558450729933733888,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,9,kinda sad
558450923236622339,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,108,votoms ||they were in love_ torn apart by war_ and ended up in a fight to the death_ one killing the other||
558451872898351124,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,145,yeah <#269247167019876352> would be the place to post that and discuss it. that said I'm sure there's people here that can give some useful input
558452358544097292,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,113,well you brought it to people's attention here. If there are people interested in helping they can go over therre
558453609034022932,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,84,I like votoms quite a bit but find myself watching it more slowly than anything else
558453740957466670,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,61,often after 1 ep I'm satisfied_ and move on to something else
558453802286579722,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,19,maybe 2-3 sometimes
558472976480075778,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,3,hmm
558473290994417664,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,19,hi home_ I'm Nomeru
558473378525216803,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,4,nice
558756499103547443,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,50,fapo -> f/z -> encore -> ubw -> fgo -> illya -> hf
558756514228076548,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,20,there_ hf at the end
558756700572614656,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,11,forgot deen
558756901995806731,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,14,fate apocrypha
558757078429204481,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,70,remove spinoffs and you're just left with ubw and hf I think_ and deen
558757112113528842,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,49,maybe h/z depending on how loosely you count that
558759257714196515,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,90,I kinda think only way I'll ever watch anything past zero is if they adapt the first route
558759350873751556,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,30,and that seems pretty unlikely
558759432364752917,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,32,I've just kinda given up on fate
558764457375825934,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,28,mob s2 has been really great
558764519246266399,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,14,better than s1
558764594810585138,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,38,hopefully we'll have s3 announced soon
558764656525705222,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,53,or if there's not enough content a movie or something
558764693901148195,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,28,they can't not finish it now
558783541434122242,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,25,only anime staff position
558783585348354098,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,38,no one else listed as character design
558783825170268173,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,43,that person didn't work on the manga though
558783839363792897,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,9,ann lists
558784001356201994,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,54,then isn't listed as working on whatever the source is
558784056897306636,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,56,that is the only relating credit they have_ which is odd
558784523660165140,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,51,Also not clear what original character design means
558784589053820928,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,110,does that mean they did character design for the novels_ or they did character design for new anime characters
558784818792628224,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,22,might be up in the air
558784859502280725,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,33,says still publishing on mal also
558785017682067467,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,24,when did the author die?
558785180161277953,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,19,oh 10 years ago huh
558785332666171393,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,65,wikipedia shows 130 volumes with nothing released since 2009_ idk
558785620332380160,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,209,```A record 100 volumes were originally planned_[3] but the final total stands at 130 volumes and 22 side-story novels_ with the last four volumes and the twenty-second side novel published posthumously.[4]```
558785693313138690,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,44,so they did release 5 volumes after she died
558785731380641822,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,22,sounds pretty done now
558785801228648463,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,6,or not
558785843502907392,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,248,```The main story of Guin Saga resumed on November 8_ 2013_ four years after the passing of the original author. YÅ« Godai published Volume 131 Parro no Ankoku on that date_ followed by Yume Yohino's Volume 132 Cylon no Banka in December 2013.[9]```
558786158302330900,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,81,really interesting how they say they started out planning on it being 100 volumes
558786179462463489,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,25,how do you plan for that?
558792467416219664,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,34,levi watch any more votoms lately?
558792529525473282,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,36,I'm at 29 now_ it's been pretty good
558792565835694080,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,37,though 28 was a recap for some reason
558792788653768708,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,94,votoms ||yeah she was useless there_ I hear in the 3rd part where I am now she really shines||
558792830600871936,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,20,Chirico is great too
558793320890105866,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,21,that didn't bother me
558793411965091842,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,43,doesn't seem like that will continue though
558793780036239396,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,2,no
558793933103038476,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,69,They are the most realistic mecha designs_ for whatever that's worth.
558793981152985098,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,48,they're like 4 meters tall_ like a personal tank
558794100648706079,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,110,bipedal though they use wheels on their feet more often than actually walking it seems. or at least like 50/50
558802701303939073,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,35,why would preorders for a game end?
558802732706693120,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,36,aside from because the game came out
558848008456896523,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,27,I might give domekano a 6-7
558848119974920202,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,4,fix?
558848157622992896,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,34,also what_ I haven't seen any tits

558848390373572619,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,3,dm?
558848698168246293,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,27,I haven't seen anything yet
558848737732984867,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,19,but now I'm curious
558848899675062283,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,30,oh those screenshots look nice
558849006780809226,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,ricey it wasn't really censored
558849048355012617,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,51,this uh looks like they're adding more to it though
558850861451968532,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,2,no
558851349890990105,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,39,the only fox boy that matters is kurama
558851783645200385,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,37,I guess it's not about hotness for me
558851855568863233,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,44,I bet kurama would kick that other fox's ass
558852176764600340,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,7,naruto?

558853398405971988,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,99,heard years ago it was a one piece ripoff though that shouldn't really be a problem since I like OP
558853526047162380,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,31,I don't really plan on watching

560999789634912288,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,275,went to a mexican restaurant a while back_ and I can only assume it was the owner was going around playing this accordion and handing out flowers. It was loud and obnoxious_ and he kept stopping at all the tables and asking us how we were doing and interrupting conversations
