558757562057490463,98,Lol_ first time I joined a public lobby since like forever and two afk partners. Tf was I thinking
558757839380807752,4,Same
558757960785068062,62,There’ll probs be a perkup but like the worst combination ever
558758037259681852,39,1 epic with rare and uncommon RTD pl 70
558758335596199946,32,Damn_ no good vacuum tube sniper
558758466638970933,75,Headshot explosions -.- LOVE that perk but not a fan of it with that sniper
558758710789406761,62,They’re all pretty much outperformed by a selection of weapons
558758792016166932,95,I just wanted the tube sniper since it’s very unique and cool imo + goes super nice with Zenith
558758899629424660,1,?
558759068521725955,68,Idk why I even bothered answering you knowing your chat history here
558759101459333153,9,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
558762960915529739,91,Jesus_ a single storm mission that’s offering either legendary or epic perkup this rotation
558763061176172581,9,Yeah haha
558763386066960388,74,I’m not necessarily low but since it’s a cat 4 100_ I might grind it a bit
558763421433200658,20,Plus chill modifiers
558763523921149962,29,smoke screens_ wall weakening
558763553444593674,10,fire storm
558763775759613963,94,Yeah I’m 1.6 or around that. Going to be levelling up a few snipers later so that’ll drop haha
558763890293342230,70,I think I might hit under a million if I level up the few snipers soon
558763989702541337,99,Now that I think about it_ I’m doing that alert later for sure if you wanna do it as well still Box
558764100419846174,6,Cool 😎
558764162835283980,62,Perfect time to try out Zenith as well since it’s a fire storm
558764420658888714,1,🤣
558764790697426946,54,Hmmm might do that pl76 RTL 4-players actually as well
558764889406177280,74,Deathwing schematic 😛 Perfect time since I’m still building Zenith loadout
558765122936635403,58,I have multiple_ I just want a wide selection to play with
558765238116417536,21,I have bundle as well
558765480182153262,94,But not a fan of using bundlebuss for weaker husks. Quite overkill + lots of ammo being wasted
558765559269949470,93,And the explosion perk being triggered can be inconsistent since you kill the enemies so fast
558765791789580318,24,Levelling up Frostbite 😎
558765869514227713,59,If I were to ever use it_ now is the only time to do so lol
558766035650478101,45,I like how the Frostbite is in terms of perks
558766147764486149,4,Yeah
558766306422292490,33,<@!302921272482856972> How is it?
558766530666692608,46,Can you one shot headshot weak husks at least?
558766581195341858,1,👍
558766981793185816,75,Aye that’s awesome! Running it with sniper buffs so that’ll be even greater
558767439966502953,95,I think I’ll also be using an obliterator with my Zenith since I got an extra one to make as SS
558768937333030924,126,Alrighty_ so far made the Frostbite 106 with all epic perks except for crit rating being legendary. Gonna see how it goes soon
558769739040686100,89,Can someone confirm: Crankshot does not offer damage to snared/afflicted perk in 5th slot
558770147536666625,8,Thanks 👍
558770346019520532,72,I will be using my 5x headshots Crank then. Seems the best for my Zenith
558781254267437057,8,This guy
558781285414469677,1,🤣
558783610614972427,47,Yeah_ I keep having to replace current loadouts
558803044733681664,25,LOADS of tickets as well!
558809521451958313,67,Osiris said he’ll be back after his smoke break so he’ll probs join
558809589852667905,36,He said that like 4 hours ago though
558853488621256709,94,It always will be that specific reset (early morning for me) where we get a godly perkup alert
558853572159209502,3,Lol
558854141334519808,56,Cool_ I’m in lobby btw. Just join off me_ should be open
558854170472349707,19,Getting pineapple 😎
558854287409545216,32,Yeah_ best friend is coming over
558854316480266240,22,I act like she’s my gf
559098107183235082,47,Box and Osiris_ get ready for that perkup alert
559098174040702977,20,Last night was fun 😎
559109210726596623,62,I agree_ Twine’s future quests should take place in Ghost Town
