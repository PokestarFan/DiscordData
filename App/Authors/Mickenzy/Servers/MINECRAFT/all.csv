560949473472282624,builds,33,XD yeah_ it's the opposite for me
560949494573826068,builds,32,I need the challenge of survival
560949596570910730,builds,93,just being able to place whatever blocks_ in whatever amounts I want makes it less fun for me
560949946803814401,builds,62,Yeah_ I totally get why people would like to build in creative
560949983549849610,builds,20,it's just not for me

560950388480540682,builds,83,I think what it is_ is that building in survival gives it all more longevity for me

560954634651435029,builds,105,how do you guys go about making roads with multiple different blocks_ and make them look randomly placed?
560954665060139019,builds,52,so that the road doesn't end up with a pattern in it
560954889090629633,builds,3,lol
560954960926212157,builds,78,I suppose I could use multisided dice_ and assign a number to each block... XD
