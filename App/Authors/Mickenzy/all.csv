560948181823782933,MINECRAFT,builds,95,you could make a dining table with dining chairs... I like to use doors as chair backs for that
560948682204119040,MINECRAFT,builds,3,ahh
560949311244861451,MINECRAFT,builds,78,yeah.. but I do like to just build stuff for the hell of it in survival too XD
560949399082237982,MINECRAFT,builds,58,if I just built stuff in creative_ I know I'd get bored :/
560949473472282624,MINECRAFT,builds,33,XD yeah_ it's the opposite for me
560949494573826068,MINECRAFT,builds,32,I need the challenge of survival
560949596570910730,MINECRAFT,builds,93,just being able to place whatever blocks_ in whatever amounts I want makes it less fun for me
560949946803814401,MINECRAFT,builds,62,Yeah_ I totally get why people would like to build in creative
560949983549849610,MINECRAFT,builds,20,it's just not for me
560950041825771520,MINECRAFT,builds,43,now_ *experimenting* in creative is helpful
560950100998881291,MINECRAFT,builds,15,Lol that's fair
560950146242707466,MINECRAFT,builds,42,I've built stuff like that in survival >.>
560950388480540682,MINECRAFT,builds,83,I think what it is_ is that building in survival gives it all more longevity for me
560950457854459905,MINECRAFT,builds,42,but I also have never made any mega builds
560950736528080926,MINECRAFT,builds,29,yeah.. that dragon is amazing
560950754316386306,MINECRAFT,builds,38,I could never make something like that
560950768492871700,MINECRAFT,builds,24,in creative or otherwise
560951143996325912,MINECRAFT,builds,75,that's another part of why I like playing in survival... there's more to do
560951209729589315,MINECRAFT,builds,70,I mean.. you can the same stuff in creative_ but what for_ y'know? lol
560954178759950356,MINECRAFT,builds,36,yeaaaah that looks pretty ridiculous
560954634651435029,MINECRAFT,builds,105,how do you guys go about making roads with multiple different blocks_ and make them look randomly placed?
560954665060139019,MINECRAFT,builds,52,so that the road doesn't end up with a pattern in it
560954889090629633,MINECRAFT,builds,3,lol
560954960926212157,MINECRAFT,builds,78,I suppose I could use multisided dice_ and assign a number to each block... XD
560955022700052490,MINECRAFT,builds,30,that would take forever though
560955027670302723,MINECRAFT,builds,3,lol
560955208335884308,MINECRAFT,builds,2,no
560955752341045299,MINECRAFT,builds,14,it's dead_ Jim
560958022239911957,MINECRAFT,builds,49,that way they're like camouflaged murder holes :D
