559096675650633748,197,just looked it up <@!366578109404938250>  seems like it should be able to run together. Except that FAWE doesn't know what to do with blocks outside normal build range... so maybe do that manually?
559096784459137024,79,<@416425695632293888>  place light source below_ they will then be normal color
559097042920800267,100,lolz_ anyway if you want to test somethings out use a test world XD would be a shame if mods mess up
559097231727132716,53,ah_ and btw. that look gorgeous <@191378845612507136>

559097677070073888,93,ah cool_ for the Elysium Fire right? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxXk1bYanBg> cool stuff
559097972500201492,108,absolutely insane that there are groups of people who are committed and talented enough to build such things
559098207637078026,29,ok_ nice stuff. Looks amazing
559099001031622676,282,Yeah_ a year or so back I checked them out (one of their free download builds) to look at building styles and was kind of disappointed that all builds were filled with dirt ðŸ˜…  Think it always a shame if people go for only the render and not finish it off as complete minecraft build
559099338882547715,84,I mean it looks great_ but yeah. Discover it in Minecraft itself is just super cool.
