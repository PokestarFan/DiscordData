559099577056231435,52,i can *only* see it being rushed for yu-no though...
559099632743874571,49,unless the remake organically shortens the length
559099694580498477,80,cause the og is a sufficient enough length that i cant see it fitting in 2 cours

559100816451960832,142,there's this one character that's essentially just like the mc of bunny girl_ but the show doesn't want him to mature and keeps him an asshole
