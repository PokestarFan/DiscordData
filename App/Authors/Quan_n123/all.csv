If a business starts a business and noones buys his product_ he stops the business because the market tells him that right now that isn't the most efficient way to use resources_ thus he might invest in another business that provides a valuable good/service
558463605893365793,r/teenagers,debates,196,The markets are an important part of capitalism. Yes_ the essence of capitalism is the private control of means of production_ however_ without markets_ there wouldn't even be a net profit to gain
558464651860508692,r/teenagers,debates,169,The difference between Feudalism and Capitalism is that capitalism respects property rights.. In feudalism_ the land is Owned by the crown_ and given out to the nobility
558464866151563264,r/teenagers,debates,128,i mean the serfs lived on the land_ but they had no choice to because all the land is owned by the nobility (given by the crown)
