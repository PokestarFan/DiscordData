558463605893365793,196,The markets are an important part of capitalism. Yes_ the essence of capitalism is the private control of means of production_ however_ without markets_ there wouldn't even be a net profit to gain
558464651860508692,169,The difference between Feudalism and Capitalism is that capitalism respects property rights.. In feudalism_ the land is Owned by the crown_ and given out to the nobility
558464866151563264,128,i mean the serfs lived on the land_ but they had no choice to because all the land is owned by the nobility (given by the crown)
558465671743275028,140,Yeah_ the burghers owned manufacturing_ but they were given the land by the king themselves. They were given capital without working for it.
