560609828112826389,bedrock-store-feedback,284,Tbh it would look like a bookshelf. Design is this. Empty with no books and then would tranisition into a full "bookshelf" with a certain amount of books on. Would be a custom interface_ different from a chest. It would be cool!NLIf you added book covers_ maybe use banners to do that!
