560641751115628545,Comedy Heaven,gaminger-zone,52,ah yes_ the E180s and the "that's a Treuno?" Corolla
560977407457230858,Comedy Heaven,serious,141,has anyone ever argued with someone and the person you're arguing with acts like it's because you're arguing about it with them in particular
560977521286447114,Comedy Heaven,serious,83,because honestly_ it's one of the most annoying fucking things i've ever dealt with
560977679956967459,Comedy Heaven,serious,53,basically_ i moderate another server with another guy
560977713523851294,Comedy Heaven,serious,20,let's call him...bob
560977896076869636,Comedy Heaven,serious,111,Now_ every time we argue_ Bob always pulls the "you're arguing with me because the point I made comes from me".
560978917565923361,Comedy Heaven,serious,9,In a way.
560978948314628097,Comedy Heaven,serious,19,I'm the oldest one.
560978984951873566,Comedy Heaven,serious,36,And the longest friend of the owner.
560979078858145815,Comedy Heaven,serious,16,It is_ honestly.
560979211326717972,Comedy Heaven,serious,50,Like I said_ he thinks I'm after him or something.
560979362896281661,Comedy Heaven,serious,101,He's had people complain he's a useless mod (despite the fact that he's not_ verifiably) in the past.
560979420517498890,Comedy Heaven,serious,55,I probably said something like that *once*_ months ago.
560979455548325900,Comedy Heaven,serious,29,I'd like to keep that secret.
560979590831538187,Comedy Heaven,serious,61,Don't want to give any unneeded attention to the "situation".
560979762986745856,Comedy Heaven,serious,15,I did actually.
560979801771606016,Comedy Heaven,serious,43,That was when he pulled the "bad day" card.
560980231637303296,Comedy Heaven,serious,203,I have no idea in that case. Dude has claimed to be depressed_ bad parents_ is a bit of a shrinking violet (he does sound like he wants to die and he's insanely quiet_ so 1 and 3 *may* be right)_ but idk
560980326034440212,Comedy Heaven,serious,57,When he's not being paranoid_ he's generally an okay guy.
560980402626363411,Comedy Heaven,serious,70,Except when he randomly doesn't talk in the middle of conversations...
560980448101138437,Comedy Heaven,serious,25,but that's another thing.
560980496901865511,Comedy Heaven,serious,6,Voice.
