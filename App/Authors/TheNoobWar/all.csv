558457121780400129,r/teenagers,general,7,excused
558466377128607765,r/teengamingnights,general,99,why do you believe that anything that has to do with rules or policies includes a democratic vote??
558466404190388234,r/teengamingnights,general,39,what community behaves in such a manner
558466408200142848,r/teengamingnights,general,4,lmao
558466431424135179,r/teengamingnights,general,34,it's not an election for a country
558466492811968523,r/teengamingnights,general,21,<@528391460882743307>
558466620658417666,r/teengamingnights,general,108,by participating and playing on this server nowhere have I ever advertised that the users decide on anything
558466654263181312,r/teengamingnights,general,32,that's not how any of this works
558466778989330442,r/teengamingnights,general,20,then he'll be banned
558466782835245056,r/teengamingnights,general,6,simple
558466818553937952,r/teengamingnights,general,19,then it gets denied
558466905694928923,r/teengamingnights,general,43,because we have rules and policies in place
558466958551416834,r/teengamingnights,general,95,and that there's more to everything than you know than just simply being a player on our server
558467050847076354,r/teengamingnights,general,44,his initial ban was for griefing/entity kill
558467094140944394,r/teengamingnights,general,18,the kill was valid
558467163841888276,r/teengamingnights,general,39,then if he breaks rules he'll be banned
558467170502443009,r/teengamingnights,general,14,simple as that
558467212864782356,r/teengamingnights,general,52,not going to debate about any moderator actions here
558467270809223179,r/teengamingnights,general,45,you disagree that's fine_ that's your opinion
558467389990371358,r/teengamingnights,general,91,if we bend the procedures in place just because some parts of the community dislikes a user
558467500128600064,r/teengamingnights,general,110,then that sets a dirty precedent for bans to occur to anyone like you even though it doesn't violate the rules
558467517341761544,r/teengamingnights,general,20,okay then don't play
558467542197338112,r/teengamingnights,general,42,simple_ click quit game_ and never rejoin.
558467550644666378,r/teengamingnights,general,15,problem solved.
558467603165872147,r/teengamingnights,general,78,you have issues and claim corruptness_ give me examples and i'll look into it.
558467701824159766,r/teengamingnights,general,23,ok do you have examples
558467713899429908,r/teengamingnights,general,36,or are you just going to make claims
558467728965632032,r/teengamingnights,general,23,and perform a witchhunt
558467783390658560,r/teengamingnights,general,78,cause i have an example of you rn doing a witchhunt which is against the rules
558467829272281089,r/teengamingnights,general,35,!!ban <@272432382169055235> goodbye
558467876357537803,r/teengamingnights,general,35,not here to be belittled by a child
558468133099274257,r/teengamingnights,general,148,<@528391460882743307> server gameplay is taken into consideration of player's wishes but not everything will be made with the vote of the playerbase
558468202716201001,r/teengamingnights,general,103,it's just how it is_ players sometimes may pick the option that's not the best choice in mind for them.
558468242796969985,r/teengamingnights,general,93,i've seen this happen multiple times as my tenure as moderator for this community for 4 years
558468309096464385,r/teengamingnights,general,73,you just simply can't have a 'democratic' vote on policies and procedures
558468342416015383,r/teengamingnights,general,79,its what moderators are there for to ensure the community is in the best health
558468402281316354,r/teengamingnights,general,94,if you wish to be more involved in this process join ARC's next term_ or apply as a moderator.
