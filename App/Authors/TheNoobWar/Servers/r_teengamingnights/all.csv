558466377128607765,general,99,why do you believe that anything that has to do with rules or policies includes a democratic vote??
558466404190388234,general,39,what community behaves in such a manner
558466408200142848,general,4,lmao
558466431424135179,general,34,it's not an election for a country
558466492811968523,general,21,<@528391460882743307>
558466620658417666,general,108,by participating and playing on this server nowhere have I ever advertised that the users decide on anything
558466654263181312,general,32,that's not how any of this works
558466778989330442,general,20,then he'll be banned
558466782835245056,general,6,simple
558466818553937952,general,19,then it gets denied
558466905694928923,general,43,because we have rules and policies in place
558466958551416834,general,95,and that there's more to everything than you know than just simply being a player on our server
558467050847076354,general,44,his initial ban was for griefing/entity kill
558467094140944394,general,18,the kill was valid
558467163841888276,general,39,then if he breaks rules he'll be banned
558467170502443009,general,14,simple as that
558467212864782356,general,52,not going to debate about any moderator actions here
558467270809223179,general,45,you disagree that's fine_ that's your opinion
558467389990371358,general,91,if we bend the procedures in place just because some parts of the community dislikes a user
558467500128600064,general,110,then that sets a dirty precedent for bans to occur to anyone like you even though it doesn't violate the rules
558467517341761544,general,20,okay then don't play
558467542197338112,general,42,simple_ click quit game_ and never rejoin.
558467550644666378,general,15,problem solved.
558467603165872147,general,78,you have issues and claim corruptness_ give me examples and i'll look into it.
558467701824159766,general,23,ok do you have examples
558467713899429908,general,36,or are you just going to make claims
558467728965632032,general,23,and perform a witchhunt
558467783390658560,general,78,cause i have an example of you rn doing a witchhunt which is against the rules
558467829272281089,general,35,!!ban <@272432382169055235> goodbye
558467876357537803,general,35,not here to be belittled by a child
558468133099274257,general,148,<@528391460882743307> server gameplay is taken into consideration of player's wishes but not everything will be made with the vote of the playerbase
558468202716201001,general,103,it's just how it is_ players sometimes may pick the option that's not the best choice in mind for them.
558468242796969985,general,93,i've seen this happen multiple times as my tenure as moderator for this community for 4 years
558468309096464385,general,73,you just simply can't have a 'democratic' vote on policies and procedures
558468342416015383,general,79,its what moderators are there for to ensure the community is in the best health
558468402281316354,general,94,if you wish to be more involved in this process join ARC's next term_ or apply as a moderator.
558762716505047060,general,32,TacoBellSecondDinner at his best
558792707288465456,general,8,it's not
558792723663159299,general,12,192.168.* is
558792790792863744,general,52,there's still ip blocks allocated in the 192.* range
558792853703229440,general,32,and his ip is 198.* not 192.* :P
558803675137703936,general,1,?
