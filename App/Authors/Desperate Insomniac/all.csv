558823231067521026,masterani.me,lounge,558,Design a program that will display an inches –to-centimeters conversion table.  The smallest and largest number of inches in the table are input values.  Your table must give conversions in 6-inch intervals.   Treat the largest number of inches as a cap. That means that if the next inch value to be calculated (when counting by 6) is greater than the largest input_ then that next inch value is not converted and does not appear on the table. One inch is equivalent to 2.54 cm.  Display the output to 2 decimal places and right align both columns of output.

558839339665063956,masterani.me,lounge,29,not exactly made it right tho

558839853463240732,masterani.me,lounge,45,i noticed that but Idk how to change that lio
558840052873035776,masterani.me,lounge,16,idk what that is
558840123136016405,masterani.me,lounge,24,you mean a switch maybe?
558840197593432075,masterani.me,lounge,63,all I know about are switches_ and loops beside just basic code
558840992745127957,masterani.me,lounge,4,well
558841004736774154,masterani.me,lounge,9,he did it
558841146646855694,masterani.me,lounge,42,so I needed to make inches = smallestinch?
558841347377987599,masterani.me,lounge,57,and how come inches is <largestinch and not smallest inch
558841601192099842,masterani.me,lounge,58,I basically had it but I had a few key things flip flopped
558841665549369379,masterani.me,lounge,13,is there like
558841905132339213,masterani.me,lounge,56,inches = smallest inch just doesn't make sense to me tho
558842185915695134,masterani.me,lounge,82,so the inches variable is a basically another variable to make the +6 thing happen
558842293457518624,masterani.me,lounge,80,because if smallestinch + 6 then there wouldn't be a smallest inch anymore right
558842321504829450,masterani.me,lounge,38,it would 6 more than the smallest inch
558842434075885606,masterani.me,lounge,88,so the inches is just so the smallest inch stays and the inches does the +6 thing for it
558842949144936469,masterani.me,lounge,135,theres only one more thing on this question that needs done_ the output needs to be formatted like a chart kinda_ and idk how to do tha
558843067055210506,masterani.me,lounge,66,like my teacher wants it_ Inches  number       centimeters numbers
558843132846800929,masterani.me,lounge,40,and then others ones below it as follows
558843202631893012,masterani.me,lounge,40,not going vertically down like I have it

558844246690365460,masterani.me,lounge,19,I made it unaligned
558844292173398016,masterani.me,lounge,30,Did I just put too many spaces
558844360649867264,masterani.me,lounge,18,too little spaces?
558844845234454529,masterani.me,lounge,8,I got it
558844900821565440,masterani.me,lounge,45,is there more than just putting blank spaces?
558844916843806721,masterani.me,lounge,23,or is that literally it
558845020543778816,masterani.me,lounge,69,cause thats what I did but doesn't look  as pretty in the source code
558845216614907934,masterani.me,lounge,65,pretty sure theres a way to like tab like how \n makes a new line

558868315385233437,masterani.me,lounge,37,but I am confused about this one part
558868967607762982,masterani.me,lounge,31,<:pepehands:495739984805101570>
