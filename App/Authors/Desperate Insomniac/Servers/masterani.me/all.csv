558823231067521026,lounge,558,Design a program that will display an inches â€“to-centimeters conversion table.  The smallest and largest number of inches in the table are input values.  Your table must give conversions in 6-inch intervals.   Treat the largest number of inches as a cap. That means that if the next inch value to be calculated (when counting by 6) is greater than the largest input_ then that next inch value is not converted and does not appear on the table. One inch is equivalent to 2.54 cm.  Display the output to 2 decimal places and right align both columns of output.
