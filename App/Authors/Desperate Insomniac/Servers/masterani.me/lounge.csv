558440173172686859,36,I am grinding college work right now
558440193535770646,17,Not time to smash
558756424885338139,1,?
558756459287150596,19,You banned the dude
558756481391132713,3,Rip
558756510339956748,2,Oh
558756535426220094,21,Then he probably left
558756738359099422,42,Nex jacked off so hard he broke his router
558757726352703501,35,Apparently sekiro isn't multiplayer
558757737459351562,8,Feelsbad
558757786389970957,52,Wanted to play with friends like I did in dark souls
558757840068673536,37,Well dark souls worked in multiplayer
558757932104286249,11,Ye but like
558757947111505930,8,Feelsbad
558758029177257985,33,I mean I liked having multiplayer
558758045321265152,8,It's fun
558758078112202762,40,Sorry I liked having fun with my friends
558758169946357760,17,Yeah coop was fun
558758316092817429,35,Blood borne worked with multiplayer
558758360044797952,46,So I just figured sekiro was gonna have it too
558758559928680459,56,I mean how could you know if multiplayer was never in it
558758754883993697,33,I gotta get a new Xbox controller
558758846055579692,32,Tomorrow i will probably buy ine
558759069519839243,17,Preorder benefits
558759090353078282,2,Ha
558759166404067328,31,Get your ingame item and poster
558759249363075072,36,Reason to preorder is to pre install
558759277171572736,25,So it's already installed
558759299439001629,17,When it comes out
558760846264893454,40,You get to see it when the game boots up
558760857329205250,16,That's something
558760880612048902,25,<:LUL:370919755449892875>
558761034433953804,60,Just take the cover of the game out and tape it to your wall
558762057521168394,35,Stop giving nomura director control
558763046906888242,25,Controllers where it's at
558763330869657633,34,Xbox 360 controller is pretty good
558763413443051550,46,Xbox one and PS4 controllers pretty decent too
558763517721837579,22,I like PS3 or 4 better
558763546800947236,28,Just an improvement of the 2
558763916969246741,2,No
558811170157625354,36,You know what the biggest problem is
558811201329692672,24,With all these newcomers
558811302521470989,82,The two people who helped me with programming are now constantly on do not disturb
558811357726900257,54,Thanks a lot newcomers <:pepehands:495739984805101570>
558811415465426948,15,Anthony and Flo
558811478547759124,31,<:pepehands:495739984805101570>
558811560999649302,36,Programming is definitely not for me
558811600518250496,32,No computer science major for me
558811749436882944,51,It's boring and all the syntax and shit confuses me
558811914512236574,52,I hated algebra and this shit literally just algebra
558812736138510346,75,This is highly unlikely mainly because people don't go to Barnes and nobles
558812795894890498,51,I would know I go to Barnes and Nobles occasionally
558812820225916928,9,It's dead
558812893127114792,29,I mean are you good at it shu
558812963654336532,28,I am sorry is your name desp
558812973158760448,26,<:Uwot:231136942236893184>
558813181523394570,70,I mean I would at least take a class where you actually do programming
558813230458208260,33,To see if you still want to do it
558813337798836325,50,Well I am trying to grind programming hw right now
558813583379529739,79,I think I might legitimately look into being an accountant even tho I hate math
558813676711313408,68,Cause the accounting class I am is slight and Everything makes sense
558813756117876758,46,I just have to memorize how these sheets works
558813779471630336,13,And that's it
558813824816381954,46,Know how to do this when this and this happens
558813911969693717,41,Do I have to cut my hair as an accountant
558813943762780160,23,That's the deal breaker
558814046246404096,90,I walked around 4-7 hours a day usually doing nothing but walk in circles at my retail job
558814091175657482,24,I can handle some boring
558814215930904577,21,I don't have ambition
558814247488847872,36,Just give me a set plan I can follow
558814361188171776,28,Like a buck over minium wage
558814487449174016,54,My main clientele are old ladies and middle aged women
558814513642864670,28,They usually aren't horrible
558814560845299722,36,Occasionally we get a sassy old lady
558814622291853312,62,But usually it's just the gay men couples that are jerks to us
558814699823824906,53,Very uptight and trying to get deals that Don't exist
558814746275610642,43,And getting very angry when we tell them no
558814831965372430,18,Well I am a virgin
558814859635195937,20,So I guess no listen
558814954963206147,37,I work with mainly middle aged people
558815023116320778,22,2 people around my age
558815285084422197,6,I mean
558815348376338434,83,As long as the rich people just talk bad about me behind my back and not to my face
558815360498008095,14,I will be fine
558815644984803358,18,!img lollia singer
558815671673159700,19,That's not a person
558815722587947019,11,!img lollia
558815781559861268,24,!img lollia singer cover
558815877651234817,12,She looks ok
558815948329713707,36,Can't really tell much from that pic
558816091753807893,24,Most women wear too much
558816146632081448,49,Its just done in a way that doesn't look too much
558816392795652107,58,Unless he means to fit in cause everyone else wears makeup
558816411708030997,26,I don't know what he means
558816663202431033,167,There is definitely a stigma that you need to wear makeup as a girl growing up. Girls would be ripped apart by the other girls if they didn't when they were growing up
558816777342287872,33,Most those peeps wear make up tho
558816880920494084,22,Already deepily rooted
558816999397130250,41,I mean I would still say it's a thing now
558817125335040001,119,Just more everyone on the internet does it_ all the celebs do it_ so they feel they gotta do it to be like them etc etc
558817263449276446,19,Idk what that it is
558817313789313034,14,Yes neets were
558817345385005069,8,In Japan
558817582891925506,47,Thats cause you don't talk to anyone either shu
558817622364520469,20,That's what they say
558817640836104192,17,When they see you
558818207583043585,32,Sounds like a rapey thing to say
558818242169274371,22,Unwavering loyalty huh

558818752960004138,11,While loops
558818784597770240,18,And do while loops
558818806701752320,13,And for loops
558818854143393792,44,I only barely sort of understand while loops

558819016458633216,9,Basically
558819067322957844,27,I did some python years ago

558819323825750037,31,I got 3 hours till this all due

558819801028624432,92,Dude if that was enough for me to understand how it works i wouldn't be taking a class on it
558819844133224469,31,I would be in the major leagues
558820110811267088,50,I need someone going step by step with me honestly
558820178054479883,19,That's not the same
558820288385515546,92,I basically need a tutor but nobody in my programming class knows what they are doing either
558820330735403019,24,They come to me for help
558820457651109888,60,Last time I asked her for help she didn't respond back to me
558821436161130527,31,So what is this ++variable shit
558821534152785922,52,All I know is I need to have this included sometimes
558821596605972480,45,And I don't know how to choose which variable
558821937682317342,32,But why is that just on its own?
558822095157461022,53,I understand when it's like variable += variable2 etc
558822131434127365,33,But I don't get when there's just
558822150178471995,11,Variable ++
558822971192639502,22,If I post the question
558823002251460608,27,And the source code I tried
558823047285702656,50,You think any of you can tell me what I did wrong?
558823231067521026,558,Design a program that will display an inches â€“to-centimeters conversion table.  The smallest and largest number of inches in the table are input values.  Your table must give conversions in 6-inch intervals.   Treat the largest number of inches as a cap. That means that if the next inch value to be calculated (when counting by 6) is greater than the largest input_ then that next inch value is not converted and does not appear on the table. One inch is equivalent to 2.54 cm.  Display the output to 2 decimal places and right align both columns of output.

558828231919140867,30,what is kudasai supposed to be
558828484525424681,39,does round just mean round the numbers?
558828513659191306,19,I know this isn't C
558829086705713164,34,I know how to round I believe in c
558829508900421651,43,I somewhat think I know how to translate it
558829582883749923,45,not sure on what to put for the while ( ) tho
558829999730196480,1,?
558832873914761216,77,i think the conditional statement will be that while(smallerinch<largestinch)
558832978151604236,35,or is it while (inches<largestinch)
558834652241068043,38,my math values aren't coming out right
558836372421476363,17,the math is wrong

558837919943491605,4,also
558837974251339804,24,2 inches isn't 16 inches
558838147472162826,21,well how do I fix it?
558838395980218424,11,what stuff?
558839301178392588,22,that changed something
558839339665063956,29,not exactly made it right tho

558839853463240732,45,i noticed that but Idk how to change that lio
558840052873035776,16,idk what that is
558840123136016405,24,you mean a switch maybe?
558840197593432075,63,all I know about are switches_ and loops beside just basic code
558840992745127957,4,well
558841004736774154,9,he did it
558841146646855694,42,so I needed to make inches = smallestinch?
558841347377987599,57,and how come inches is <largestinch and not smallest inch
558841601192099842,58,I basically had it but I had a few key things flip flopped
558841665549369379,13,is there like
558841905132339213,56,inches = smallest inch just doesn't make sense to me tho
558842185915695134,82,so the inches variable is a basically another variable to make the +6 thing happen
558842293457518624,80,because if smallestinch + 6 then there wouldn't be a smallest inch anymore right
558842321504829450,38,it would 6 more than the smallest inch
558842434075885606,88,so the inches is just so the smallest inch stays and the inches does the +6 thing for it
558842949144936469,135,theres only one more thing on this question that needs done_ the output needs to be formatted like a chart kinda_ and idk how to do tha
558843067055210506,66,like my teacher wants it_ Inches  number       centimeters numbers
558843132846800929,40,and then others ones below it as follows
558843202631893012,40,not going vertically down like I have it
558843247011561483,3,yes
558844200251162635,0,
558844246690365460,19,I made it unaligned
558844292173398016,30,Did I just put too many spaces
