560950247451525120,r/teenagers,debates,63,I'm honestly neutral on the Afghanistan thing_ I know to little

560950657658388480,r/teenagers,debates,85,I'm starting to be inspired by Christian-teachings I've learnt in my philosophy class

560955046259458080,r/teenagers,debates,154,I think it should encourage people to convert to Christianity but if the person truly doesn't want to be Christian they should stop trying to convert them
