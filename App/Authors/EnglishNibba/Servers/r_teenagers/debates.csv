560949229397344286,129,What does this mean?NLThe government should own all the jobs?NLThe private businesses' should own themselves?NLOr something else?
560949567126896660,33,Right I get what you mean I think
560949846756818986,31,Is this the war in Afghanistan?
560950036859453471,78,We declared war on them because of 9/11 that's the basic summary of what I knw
560950084494163978,4,Wait
560950247451525120,63,I'm honestly neutral on the Afghanistan thing_ I know to little

560950657658388480,85,I'm starting to be inspired by Christian-teachings I've learnt in my philosophy class

560954750749638657,21,I didn't say it right
560954769905025054,12,Gimmie a sec
560955046259458080,154,I think it should encourage people to convert to Christianity but if the person truly doesn't want to be Christian they should stop trying to convert them
