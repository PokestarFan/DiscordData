560948688009035777,debates,26,I somewhat agree with that
560949229397344286,debates,129,What does this mean?NLThe government should own all the jobs?NLThe private businesses' should own themselves?NLOr something else?
560949567126896660,debates,33,Right I get what you mean I think
560949846756818986,debates,31,Is this the war in Afghanistan?
560950036859453471,debates,78,We declared war on them because of 9/11 that's the basic summary of what I knw
560950084494163978,debates,4,Wait
560950247451525120,debates,63,I'm honestly neutral on the Afghanistan thing_ I know to little
560950418704695296,debates,73,All I say about Afghanistan is that I hope peace can return to the people
560950657658388480,debates,85,I'm starting to be inspired by Christian-teachings I've learnt in my philosophy class
560950706467766272,debates,46,When I'm older I might convert to Christianity

560954652552724480,debates,44,Yes but not on those who don't believe in it
560954750749638657,debates,21,I didn't say it right
560954769905025054,debates,12,Gimmie a sec
560955046259458080,debates,154,I think it should encourage people to convert to Christianity but if the person truly doesn't want to be Christian they should stop trying to convert them
560955124097351713,debates,22,Right I'll put "Agree"
560955244444385292,debates,14,Oh dios mio...

560962636641075210,debates,54,Does it mean you can't give your kids up for adoption?
560963013436506145,debates,73,I think if a family functions it's a good family_ in the simplest version
560963213278052394,debates,8,Meaning?
560963322174898186,debates,74,So does it mean we should edit it peoples genetics to make them "Perfect"?
560963476122632206,debates,64,So does it mean we should edit our genes to improve our species?
