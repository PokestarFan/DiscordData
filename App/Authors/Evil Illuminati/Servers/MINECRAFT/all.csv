560643969357316158,minecraft,190,Ok so I was collecting watermelons on my farm and then a creeper came up from behind_ I tried to run to the side real quick but got stuck in my own bush of berrier and the creeper blew up😂 😂
560647317259026443,minecraft,380,Here is a story about my unlimited dumbassory: it all began long ago_ about five minutes ago_ in the far lands of Fort Phoenix. I was peacefully harvesting my watermelons for a new build. And then a creeper came seemingly from nowhere. I dodged to the side in order to make the creeper not blow up_ but I got stuck in a berry bish that I planted myself and the creeper blew up.😂 😂

560650333504667668,minecraft,364,Hey guys_ this dude seems kinda smartNLhttps://twitter.com/TheKilroyULT/status/1110701369332129792NLNL@TheKilroyULT: I think that Minecraft Bedrock Team could have handled betas better. They could create a separate app for betas like Google does with Chrome. I know it might be difficult to do just because Minecraft is a paid app_ but I think they can figure it out.
560650866827198504,minecraft,44,Do you have a Twitter? <@431286587159216129>

560653977503399946,minecraft,350,https://twitter.com/HelenAngel/status/1111095106600341505NLNL@HelenAngel: Because folks are asking_ I say- why don’t you watch one of our official livestreams because then you’d know that the Super Duper Graphics Pack has to wait until we completely rewrite a brand new graphics engine for Bedrock- and that’s not easy! Watch our livestreams & learn! 😁
