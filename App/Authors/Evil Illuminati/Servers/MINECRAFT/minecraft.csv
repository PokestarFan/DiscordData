560647317259026443,380,Here is a story about my unlimited dumbassory: it all began long ago_ about five minutes ago_ in the far lands of Fort Phoenix. I was peacefully harvesting my watermelons for a new build. And then a creeper came seemingly from nowhere. I dodged to the side in order to make the creeper not blow up_ but I got stuck in a berry bish that I planted myself and the creeper blew up.ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚

They could create a separate app for betas like Google does with Chrome. I know it might be difficult to do just because Minecraft is a paid app_ but I think they can figure it out.
