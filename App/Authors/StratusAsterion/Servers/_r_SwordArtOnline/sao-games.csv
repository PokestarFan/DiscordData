558820413157801985,50,funny i just pulled the Sinon & Sugu from that set
559045096767488040,82,ah i found how to check_ it was just lvl_ so probably randomized all my level 80's
559045345439514665,172,still kinda surprised though because I sorted by attack_ and demon Silica_ and Undine Asuna are higher than Tsukuyomi Sinon again despite again i find her doing more damage
560990748842000384,152,since the old units are basically garbage in the new meta_ Bamco should let us sell our millions of Diavels etc to purchase some of the older shit units
560991037741465635,143,also am I to assume that the medals never re-run? so like my chocolatier medals for example are just going to live in my inventory forever now?
