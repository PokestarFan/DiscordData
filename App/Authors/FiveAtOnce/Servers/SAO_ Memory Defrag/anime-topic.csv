Her words almost failed to enter my mind_ but my brain seemed to be shouting the same thing. That red color was not the sky_ but a massive hexagonal pattern fiercely filling the space above us. Emerging on the surfaces of the shapes were the altering words: **[Warning]** and **[System Announcement]**. "Kirito-kun..." Asuna weakly called my named again. I tightly grasped her slender hand_ as in my mind a vivid memory of <<that day>> was resurrected... the day on which i had seen the very same sky four years ago.||
