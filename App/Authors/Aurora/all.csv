558444189801512961,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,71,i heard that it doesnt - i dont have it though so havent checked myself
558447005609885696,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,32,mercury lmg - bulletstorm jonesy
558447095502077982,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,56,the lmg is one of the best weapons in the game currently
558448621255786506,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,164,Also it is an LMG - and we have Crackshot who can stack his passive to 145%/50% and Bulletstorm Jonesy who can do 50%+30%Fire rate / 25% that stacks per shot you do
558448671814057995,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,53,so the bigger magazine guns are really good currently
558449013481799714,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,50,only downside is it costs 1 bacon per 100 shots :x
558453574149996595,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,143,For gold everything in the shop is Yay - it just goes down a priority list and how much oyu manage depends on how much of a life you have (lol)
558460578683682827,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,77,everything thats below rare should be transformed into rare and then recycled
558460878014513163,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,145,if you bought the training manuals in the store you should have a lot of those so i would transform into weapon and/or traps to get those manuals
558466106197672066,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,120,Personally i would prefer Sarah as i tend to use my slash in a more strategic way for the burn to do as much as possible
558466235935752204,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,97,But at the same time Scorch has a wider range so maybe the tail wouldnt be as needed if i was him
558466334589976587,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,40,i hear obsidian for the attack speed atm
558755056577413125,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,58,Crackshot does more damage on your crits than sledgehammer
558755131525693451,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,29,you need 50 shots to get 145%
558755172248059914,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,51,and sledge is only visual - you stil√∂l get the 225%
558755329517682729,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,155,you have 200+ shots - so its 150 shots at 145% - and since you have the Mercury - the explosions scale waaay better with crackshot than with Sledge anyways
558755352221581333,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,35,not when you use an LMG its not atm
558755541661515796,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,150,because there barely is a downside at all - Bulletstorm Jonesy for example outscales Sledgehammer after 17 shots for example (according to whitesushi)
558755618995961877,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,66,no - only like your first 25-30 do less - after that they do more.
558755655603716116,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,26,and you use an LMG at 200+
558755847035944981,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,138,is it a downside with weaker first shots? sure_ but Sledges weak side is that he has like 170 shots being weaker compared to crackshots 30
558755995380219924,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,87,for standard ARs you can pick pretty much any of the 3 - Crackshot/Sledge/Bullet Jonesy
558756912452206595,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,23,Mercurys explosions tbh
558757056723550208,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,89,yeah - thats why the gun is stronger than most everythign else - same with the bundlebuss
558757974718545941,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,109,there arent any missions on the event map currently - well theres one or 2 that takes you there but thats all
558758025528213513,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,65,the missions themselves are done in regular stages in any PL zone
558758478013923328,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,57,which means that 200 mag size hits 248 - depending on rng
558801402248560671,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,91,Does each pellet count as 1 shot for the super shredder on the "get 5 headshots in a row" ?
558801808177233930,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,69,then ill just keep that one for now and recycle the one that snares ?
558801965144866830,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,132,i want the explosion one though - but i sitll got a quest a few pages away that gives me a shredder - hopefully thats an explosion..
558813807380791299,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,89,Either way the Mercury LMG comes close if not highest on both fronts due to the explosion
558814544537845771,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,173,you can comment in it once every 15 minutes - use the format supposed to be used there - and if anyone is interested they will PM you - and if you are interested you PM them
558814557577936906,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,11,Have - Want
558814814500159507,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,93,to be fair though trading is largely pointless and im surprised it is as big as it is tbh ...
558827511103094804,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,28,hour? - isnt it 15 minutes ?
558828093108912128,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,156,yeah - maybe one of the bot messages arent updated then? - i know i saw 15 minutes somewhere here at least... maybe its one of the other channels... oh well
558828414723817507,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,108,pinned post says 1 hour - but if you click on the text at the top in the trade channel it says 15 minutes hm
558830348352618527,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,131,<@!304044033225785345>  according to Whitesushis sheet thingy the Reaper has higher DPS - a little less impact but more crit chance
558830653999677452,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,175,the Neon Scythe has the same DPS as the reaper though - higher attack speed and for some reason only uses 0.4 durability per attack vs the 0.52 ... so it lasts a little longer
558831050675978240,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,60,has about 1% less dps - and lasts insignificantly longer lol
558831119726805002,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,69,personally id prefer it though as it has slightly higher attack speed
558831447176380426,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,22,that i cant answer atm
558836836500504626,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,29,you can do 2 cd on it right ?
558838086784647187,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,136,Well its either CR CD CD Mag if possible_ or you replace one CD with a Fire Rate - reason being Sledgehammers support or commander skill
559102574603665450,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,215,<@!339167424228360192>  You never go Crit Damage on something if it doesnt have any Crit rating - the only exceptions are in build specific cases - like how the perk Anatomy Lessons give Crit Rating to melee weapons
560965061456429088,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,76,use stormshieldone or something like that to find them <@528932300742721576>
