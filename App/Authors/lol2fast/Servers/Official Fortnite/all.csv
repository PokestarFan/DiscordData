558796064728285204,lfg-creative,49,<@505807137214300171> Sure_ what servers are you?
558831901016850465,fortnite-general,33,<@470158583963713544> It depends.

558832948993064960,fortnite-general,42,<@321057591398760459> They're incomparable
558833078995255309,fortnite-general,113,But if I were to compare_ I would say that switch is better for controls_ while mobile is better for performance.
558833229587808297,fortnite-general,59,Yet you're able to connect a controller to a mobile device.
558833370021363733,fortnite-general,51,<@396390935656923156> You can easily get used to it
558833555350880267,fortnite-general,68,<@321057591398760459> True_ joy cons are pretty bad I have to agree.
558833753255051284,fortnite-general,39,What's the point of changing resolution
558833950794055695,fortnite-general,66,<@396390935656923156> That's all just the placebo effect in place.
558834558670340104,fortnite-general,139,<@169596815904210944> It could be possible_ you can homebrew the switch and do many things you can't do on vanilla. But I'm not risking it.
558834697325510656,fortnite-general,44,Nintendo is very strict on modding consoles.
558834913017856019,fortnite-general,75,The Wii U is much easier to mod_ but I'm not going to go too far off topic.
558835197580410912,fortnite-general,154,<@321057591398760459> Fortnite on Wii U COULD be possible_ switch has about nearly the same CPU as the Wii U and could run a solid (but not great) 25 fps.
558835839367380992,fortnite-general,24,<@224545083033255936> No
558836279182098442,fortnite-general,121,I like this server when it's on the weekdays during school. All of the idiotic 12 year olds aren't there to spam the chat
559101701852758096,fortnite-general,87,<@505123415913660427> You still have to wait a little_ it's not exactly 6 hours though.
559102025087057939,fortnite-general,43,<@447329109786230794> Don't ping epic staff
560599245309214745,fortnite-general,27,Obviously it is coming back
560600353352056842,fortnite-general,180,<@463480278686498828> Skins don't even mean anything. If you get mad because your skin returns_ you really need help. Because you're swallowing all of your self esteem on polygons.
560600518549045269,fortnite-general,67,<@463480278686498828> So 90% of companies are greedy you're saying?
560600724849950732,fortnite-general,72,<@463480278686498828> Microsoft_ Sony_ Apple. I can name plenty of more_
560600790813769758,fortnite-general,37,<@463480278686498828> Nintendo_ Sega.
560600916378648606,fortnite-general,82,<@253432942330642432> I wouldn't care personally if my battlepass skins come back.
560601051489894430,fortnite-general,95,<@463480278686498828> That's not what I'm saying. A bunch of companies don't donate to charity.
560601230427160606,fortnite-general,117,<@463480278686498828> Does that matter? You're the one buying vbucks for buying cosmetics that don't effect the game.
560601883870363660,fortnite-general,131,<@463480278686498828> Go ask Epic Games that. They give 2k vbucks to players who were falsely banned. Which is a lot in my opinion.
560601979265613845,fortnite-general,62,<@334555884514443264> I bet there's going to be molten zombies
560602103085662236,fortnite-general,43,<@463480278686498828> It's called mistakes.
560602468854267904,fortnite-general,34,I just learned a new command today
560636776591392778,fortnite-general,28,<@558906884162060308>  Chill
560636842303815710,fortnite-general,61,<@481950082963341322> I'm gonna use your code if you have one
560637040593469440,fortnite-general,73,I only use codes for small streamers trying to grow_ small accounts_ etc.
560637249168080923,fortnite-general,94,<@524257728944668686> I don't care much_ I like helping out the small accounts trying to grow.
560637432912019457,fortnite-general,39,<@524257728944668686> I'm not too sure.
560637537216102400,fortnite-general,34,Yet people are calling Epic greedy
560637671530299422,fortnite-general,23,<@560630511559770133> K
560637745026957323,fortnite-general,28,<@560630511559770133> No lol
