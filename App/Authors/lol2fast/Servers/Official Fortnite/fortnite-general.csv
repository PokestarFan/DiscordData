558832948993064960,42,<@321057591398760459> They're incomparable
558833078995255309,113,But if I were to compare_ I would say that switch is better for controls_ while mobile is better for performance.
558833229587808297,59,Yet you're able to connect a controller to a mobile device.
558833370021363733,51,<@396390935656923156> You can easily get used to it
558833555350880267,68,<@321057591398760459> True_ joy cons are pretty bad I have to agree.
558833753255051284,39,What's the point of changing resolution
558833950794055695,66,<@396390935656923156> That's all just the placebo effect in place.
558834558670340104,139,<@169596815904210944> It could be possible_ you can homebrew the switch and do many things you can't do on vanilla. But I'm not risking it.
558834697325510656,44,Nintendo is very strict on modding consoles.
558834913017856019,75,The Wii U is much easier to mod_ but I'm not going to go too far off topic.
558835197580410912,154,<@321057591398760459> Fortnite on Wii U COULD be possible_ switch has about nearly the same CPU as the Wii U and could run a solid (but not great) 25 fps.

558836279182098442,121,I like this server when it's on the weekdays during school. All of the idiotic 12 year olds aren't there to spam the chat
559101701852758096,87,<@505123415913660427> You still have to wait a little_ it's not exactly 6 hours though.
559102025087057939,43,<@447329109786230794> Don't ping epic staff
560599245309214745,27,Obviously it is coming back
560600353352056842,180,<@463480278686498828> Skins don't even mean anything. If you get mad because your skin returns_ you really need help. Because you're swallowing all of your self esteem on polygons.
560600518549045269,67,<@463480278686498828> So 90% of companies are greedy you're saying?
560600724849950732,72,<@463480278686498828> Microsoft_ Sony_ Apple. I can name plenty of more_
560600790813769758,37,<@463480278686498828> Nintendo_ Sega.
560600916378648606,82,<@253432942330642432> I wouldn't care personally if my battlepass skins come back.
560601051489894430,95,<@463480278686498828> That's not what I'm saying. A bunch of companies don't donate to charity.
560601230427160606,117,<@463480278686498828> Does that matter? You're the one buying vbucks for buying cosmetics that don't effect the game.
560601883870363660,131,<@463480278686498828> Go ask Epic Games that. They give 2k vbucks to players who were falsely banned. Which is a lot in my opinion.
560601979265613845,62,<@334555884514443264> I bet there's going to be molten zombies

560602468854267904,34,I just learned a new command today
560636776591392778,28,<@558906884162060308>  Chill
560636842303815710,61,<@481950082963341322> I'm gonna use your code if you have one
560637040593469440,73,I only use codes for small streamers trying to grow_ small accounts_ etc.
560637249168080923,94,<@524257728944668686> I don't care much_ I like helping out the small accounts trying to grow.
560637432912019457,39,<@524257728944668686> I'm not too sure.
560637537216102400,34,Yet people are calling Epic greedy

560639145039626241,83,Thanks to the Infinity Blade now in creative_ I can finally make my Juggernaut mode
560639533574782997,102,<@275350295293198337> It's a glitch that happens sometimes_ just restart your fortnite and it's fixed.
