558872616811626496,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,294,I’m on Minecraft MCPE 1.10 iPhone 6s_ and with text-to-speech on_ it sounds like the old Siri voice. In previous versions_ it sounded like the new Siri voice until 1.4. This also occurred on my iPhone 6. The strange thing is_ it didn’t change for anyone else I know. Is there any way to fix it?
