558755245056851988,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,170,I had also thought of doing Black Clover which is a guilty pleasure read of mine_  but the beginning of the anime has some real pacing issues_ or at least is really slow.
558755440377462784,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,224,Which is a shame because from what I see it speeds up a lot after the first arc or two.NLNLI had initially wanted to show a One Piece movie as that is my jam_ but theres a bit too much fanservice_ like Nami in Strong World ;_;

558755975356743720,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,25,Since comedy is my thing.
558762277017485312,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,95,Digimon I could roll with it if I can find it. The isekai premise makes it start pretty quickly
558762286462795796,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,100,Speaking of Digimon movie_ I did debate Summer Wars but I think it would be good for slightly older.
