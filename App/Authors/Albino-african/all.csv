560962723802906626,Comedy Heaven,general,26,Not like physically though
560963209956294674,Comedy Heaven,general,213,She just wants a normal healthy relationship without having arguments that make us both feel like shit but I’m prone to assuming the worse and I keep on hurting her because she thinks that she’s hurting me ya know
560963703986454528,Comedy Heaven,general,238,I’ve told her how I feel about her today and I mean like I didn’t hold back and I never thought I would open up to anyone like that ever but she had to know because I wanted her to tell me how she feels about me and how she feels about us
560964501558525981,Comedy Heaven,general,576,And she keeps on getting upset when I tell her I can come to terms with the fact I’m not the one for her and that I’m fine with her not having the same mutual feelings i have for her but she gets upset about it even though she said that our relationship is best friends forever so why does she care that I can come to terms not being her significant other and that I’m gonna keep my feelings for her to myself because the whole time I’ve been thinking our feelings were mutual so I’ve said shit I really shouldn’t have but she doesn’t want me to do that like what the fuck man

560964904253653003,Comedy Heaven,general,224,I didn’t even start developing those feelings for her until she started saying stuff that made it seem like she has them for me so of course I was gonna start feeling that way but now it turns out she never did feel that way
