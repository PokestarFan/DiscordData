558824741537054730,debates,14,assault rifles
558824752865738762,debates,17,are  made to kill
558824976719937536,debates,79,defending urself doesnt mean having  semi-automatic or automatic weapons though
558825189849432066,debates,65,sure but the typical citizen does not need a semi-automayic rifle
558825348515627029,debates,129,new zealand has one shooting and it takes a weekend to ban semi automatic rifles.  america has over 2000 and nothing has happened
558825567051579412,debates,128,im aware but dont you think the large scale of the shootings and the sheer amount of shootings would justify atleast some change
558825592833966125,debates,18,in the usa that is
558825842948440096,debates,43,we need  alot greater background checks too
558825856630390789,debates,10,in the usa
558825877883060224,debates,39,its so easy to get a gun in some places
558826020346527749,debates,112,have stricter safety peecautions_ extensive background checks and make it harder to get a gun in the first place
558826049278967818,debates,23,i didnt say u said that
558826158771404801,debates,58,like actual mental health evaluations and things like that
558826195182157834,debates,3,why
558826335599067139,debates,15,no memes please
558826462149607424,debates,123,you cant force someone to get mental health treatment but u can stop them from getting  a gun if their mental health is bad
558826546945720340,debates,49,with that logic  it applies to anything dangerous
558826583285039136,debates,66,why should drugs be illegal if people are going to get them anyway
558826684552445954,debates,7,why not
558826795370151947,debates,108,im using it to counteract the argument that 'if criminals want x they will get it so it shouldnt be illegal'
558826986005594124,debates,91,im not a psychologist  i really dont know what specific  flags would be reaso for suspicion
558827716992827392,debates,36,im trying to sort out movie nigjt rn
