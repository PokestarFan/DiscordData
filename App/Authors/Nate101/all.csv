558446314728194058,MINECRAFT,minecraft,35,what the.... what is going on here?
558446847254069259,MINECRAFT,minecraft,84,eh_ I find herobrine as a mob similar to an enderman_ more or less the name stalkers
558446927176531969,MINECRAFT,minecraft,15,also hello moon
558447084861128747,MINECRAFT,minecraft,35,I don't even know what was going on
558447123746652180,MINECRAFT,minecraft,4,yeah
558447262255153154,MINECRAFT,minecraft,56,hopefully the way the shields on java work isn't removed
558447315757695005,MINECRAFT,minecraft,2,no
558447444585742355,MINECRAFT,minecraft,19,well pocket servers
558447490156986369,MINECRAFT,minecraft,14,bedrock I mean
558447810224324619,MINECRAFT,minecraft,61,I believe new combat system should be what was built upon 1.9
558447996446965780,MINECRAFT,minecraft,73,since that combat seem like they needed more ideas_ like weapon and stuff
558448214659956751,MINECRAFT,minecraft,111,and since the new crafting blocks_ I believe that we might get more weapons with mostly weird ways to make them
558448402271174682,MINECRAFT,minecraft,2,eh
558448623868706827,MINECRAFT,minecraft,96,I believe that they should make the giant a boss and call the zombie leader or well giant zombie
558448728080646144,MINECRAFT,minecraft,51,and dragons and the other hand might be hard to add
558448851858489345,MINECRAFT,minecraft,3,.-.
