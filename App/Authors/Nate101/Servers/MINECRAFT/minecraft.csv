558446314728194058,35,what the.... what is going on here?
558446847254069259,84,eh_ I find herobrine as a mob similar to an enderman_ more or less the name stalkers
558446927176531969,15,also hello moon
558447084861128747,35,I don't even know what was going on
558447123746652180,4,yeah
558447262255153154,56,hopefully the way the shields on java work isn't removed
558447315757695005,2,no
558447444585742355,19,well pocket servers
558447490156986369,14,bedrock I mean
558447810224324619,61,I believe new combat system should be what was built upon 1.9
558447996446965780,73,since that combat seem like they needed more ideas_ like weapon and stuff
558448214659956751,111,and since the new crafting blocks_ I believe that we might get more weapons with mostly weird ways to make them
558448402271174682,2,eh
558448623868706827,96,I believe that they should make the giant a boss and call the zombie leader or well giant zombie
558448728080646144,51,and dragons and the other hand might be hard to add
558448851858489345,3,.-.
