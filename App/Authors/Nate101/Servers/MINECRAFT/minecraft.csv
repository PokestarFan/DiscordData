558446314728194058,35,what the.... what is going on here?
558446847254069259,84,eh_ I find herobrine as a mob similar to an enderman_ more or less the name stalkers
558446927176531969,15,also hello moon
558447084861128747,35,I don't even know what was going on
558447123746652180,4,yeah
558447262255153154,56,hopefully the way the shields on java work isn't removed
558447315757695005,2,no
558447444585742355,19,well pocket servers
558447490156986369,14,bedrock I mean
558447810224324619,61,I believe new combat system should be what was built upon 1.9
558447996446965780,73,since that combat seem like they needed more ideas_ like weapon and stuff
558448214659956751,111,and since the new crafting blocks_ I believe that we might get more weapons with mostly weird ways to make them
558448402271174682,2,eh
558448623868706827,96,I believe that they should make the giant a boss and call the zombie leader or well giant zombie
558448728080646144,51,and dragons and the other hand might be hard to add
558448851858489345,3,.-.

561009715971358730,6,and no
561010171766243339,57,I've got an idea for a villager which will end iron farms
561010408534573056,126,and that is a miner villager which will trade ores for emeralds and of course trade emeralds for ores that are already smelted
561010720628539393,151,and to have one of them nearby is by making sure there's already a toolsmith which would provide them with a pickaxe and level 1_ and some stone nearby
561010761602695170,2,no
561010823623868416,33,wait_ we already have stone items
561011565529399306,69,emeralds aren't really useless unless you don't have villagers around
561011981453361172,63,Minecraft Education but it's also full in Java with more things
561012225905786881,138,<@344590188863029248> similar to an achievement called "How did we get here"_ which is where you have every effect on you that you can get
