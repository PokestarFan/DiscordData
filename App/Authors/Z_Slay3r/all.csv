I know due to security reasons I could be some random stranger_ but I really don't to believe my account of over 2 years is gone. Please let me know if I can verify in any way possible.NLNLThanks_NLNLZ_Slay3r#7476

If you don't have access to these codes_ then you'll have to create a new account.NLNLI'm so sorry again for all the inconvenience and hassle because I know how frustrating it is to create a new email and account_ but please let me know if you have any other questions.NLNLNote: Please write in from the account associated with a Discord account. Otherwise_ due to security reasons_ we cannot help you.NLNLBest_NLJessie James
