558801488575725569,MINECRAFT,minecraft,68,what do y'all think about the new textures in bedrock/upcoming 1.14?
558801663163629598,MINECRAFT,minecraft,135,<@501557975757094925> you can click the @ icon in the top-right (or at the bottom in your left sidebar on mobile) to see who pinged you
558801815509139466,MINECRAFT,minecraft,113,i think i'll get used to it eventually_ but the inconsistent style makes me kinda unsettled <@334024766325391360>
558802035806568459,MINECRAFT,minecraft,110,i wish at least texture packs could be free on bedrock edition.. i mean_ i play PC_ but it's still unfortunate
558802374420987917,MINECRAFT,minecraft,15,lol same timber
558802466691612673,MINECRAFT,minecraft,100,i always call mine windows 10 edition if i'm talking to someone who's not well-versed on MC versions
558802710636527627,MINECRAFT,minecraft,75,i used to be elitist about playing on non-mobile until they made bedrock :p
558803054569193472,MINECRAFT,minecraft,137,i wish you could run private dedicated servers on bedrock edition_ or at least up the max playercount... but nooo_ gotta sell realmsss :/
558803992675614730,MINECRAFT,minecraft,119,hey_ does anyone else wish living in the desert was_ like_ possible? i wish they'd add joshua trees and sandstone tools
558804195772334080,MINECRAFT,minecraft,151,i just want a cute sandstone house in the desert_ but there's no wood which means no crafting table_ the literal most basic practical block in the game
558804265460695060,MINECRAFT,minecraft,94,i don't wanna have to venture outside the desert in order to live in the desert is what i mean
558804338550767626,MINECRAFT,minecraft,29,the wood there isn't infinite
558804414266081290,MINECRAFT,minecraft,48,..actually_ do desert villages even *have* wood?
558804679878901782,MINECRAFT,minecraft,98,well_ still can't depend on desert villages_ and mining is a pain when the stone is super far deep
558804801262190593,MINECRAFT,minecraft,87,i just want joshua trees and sandstone tools is all... not all this pillaging stuff lol
558805686025191435,MINECRAFT,minecraft,51,i literally just don't want to rely on villages lol
