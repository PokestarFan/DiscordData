558755524808671250,minecraft,64,Minecraft is not dying...NLNL.. ~~just wait till Hytale releases~~
558755819118919703,minecraft,124,||if you mention Hytale three times in <#302099229755834370> at midnight_ Helen will wipe your worlds clean in your sleep.||
558756182420881418,minecraft,172,It's all just stuff kids love to eat up. People who actually play the game ... Are doing just that. You don't see anything about the game dying within the community itself.
558756817228791820,minecraft,363,At its peak in quantity rather than quality imoNLNLSuccess isn't measured by player count (although that's what Helen and everyone else in Mojang wants us to believe.)NLNLMicrosoft's priority is making a profit. So I'm not surprised that they've managed to get **so many** dang people playing and buying stuff from the marketplace. NLNLAt least we get an update a year.
558757292019941378,minecraft,256,<@546145823118065674> vanilla survival is pretty much slow creative. I mean I agree with you but that's one of the underlying faults of Minecraft survival_ you can pretty much play the game and keep progressing forever without venturing too far from spawn.
558757722619641866,minecraft,156,<@112069415830306816> just the simple fact that the marketplace exists_ and that the Bedrock edition is targeted toward a younger audience contradicts that.
558757930191683586,minecraft,8,Yeah wtf
558758021438767114,minecraft,73,Definitely will replace that one white pixel on each eye in my game files
558758150904348687,minecraft,32,<@112069415830306816> currently?
558759175358775371,minecraft,714,<@557734965689712640> because most of the change is for the sake of change. Players have been asking for this and that for years and Mojang tends to throw us a bone and tide us over while they make their game with things we need. How much of it is developer oversight?NLNLColored beds weren't added until 1.12 even though a crap ton of people wanted it way before thenNLNLDogs/wolves are still boring. Is it that hard to make some variation to their fur texture? Maybe more commands than SITNLNLAnd when I bring this stuff up_ the first thing I'm screamed at is "just play modded lol"NLNLAnd that's how Mojang scews the "average age". Think how many 12 year olds are playing vanilla vs something like Immersive Engineering
558759535456550914,minecraft,88,Then again.. the one thing that absolutely crushes my argument...NLNLThe updates are free.
558759584039436288,minecraft,47,That's literally the best thing about this game
558759697151426578,minecraft,31,Free content at a snail's pace.
558760178929893387,minecraft,48,<@289056971007459329> updates aren't obligatory?
558760266901356546,minecraft,71,They could have left it at Minecraft 1.0 release and then made a sequel
558760352473677824,minecraft,34,<@289056971007459329> explain Halo
558760458228858897,minecraft,67,They don't "update" the games the same. Still have a lot of players
558760509105766404,minecraft,40,<@289056971007459329> not for long dude!
558760554907303957,minecraft,19,MCC is coming to PC
558760669139435522,minecraft,11,Mhm exactly
558760706539913217,minecraft,38,Doesn't really.work for a game like mc
558760787477397524,minecraft,57,But i mean they could have easily charged for each update
558760814740504576,minecraft,15,But they don't!
558761098229055500,minecraft,79,<@205739360006569984> if you're talking about java you can do that without mods
558761217666056194,minecraft,68,There's resource packs that can throw in the old textures and sounds
558761394158174218,minecraft,103,<@546145823118065674> I mean_ there are plenty games that don't have a story or plot that have a sequel
558761559560552448,minecraft,18,The engine is fine
558761646328250379,minecraft,21,Java isn't the engine
558761833620570163,minecraft,101,<@557734965689712640> if it ain't broke don't fix it..NLNLI guess we should be still in the stone ages.
558762204942565396,minecraft,3,LOL
558762240208011264,minecraft,16,Paragraph denied
558762451168919553,minecraft,192,<@546145823118065674> because if it ain't broke don't fix it... It's a stupid mentality that some people have or just say who think nothing should be improved because the current system works.
558762883882942467,minecraft,65,<@546145823118065674> yes it is. Your improving the "broke" state
