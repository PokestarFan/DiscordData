You have to have started in atleast season 5 ( if you good you dont have to play since s5 ) you need to beat one of my teammates or me ( if they are toxic report them to me woth evidence ) we also have a casual side for gamers who love fortnite and arent like a sweaty tryhard noobNLNLYou cant change your name to LilLegend(Name) example LilLegendForista or something like LL-Foristack or Foristack-LL  but you dont have to because we arent about that!
