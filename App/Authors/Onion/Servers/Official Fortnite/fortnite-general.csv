558465234768232458,138,The one from this week with the pirate cannon has been the worst offender. I usually can only do like 5 per match before someone kills you
558466386029183003,128,This game is pretty random anyway. Lots of factors in every match like weapon rng_ storm location_ and weapons other people get.
558466795179081728,152,Pump literally can go die_ i was in a shotgun battle today and at the same distance as my enemy_ he got 150 and i got only 100 so i was the one who dies
558466901479522331,49,Lmao not if you die from it <@282662439206780938>
558467453966090270,55,Lol_ the saxophone emote doesn’t work with peely at all
558468612449632267,190,Unfortunately_ i still believe that the best way to win is just the hiding/camping strategy_ unless you’re a god at this game_ getting into consistent fights means you’ll die sooner or later
558469090486779925,3,Lol
558469205884665875,41,How would mats help you vs a minigun lmao
