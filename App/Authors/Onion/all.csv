558465234768232458,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,138,The one from this week with the pirate cannon has been the worst offender. I usually can only do like 5 per match before someone kills you
558466386029183003,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,128,This game is pretty random anyway. Lots of factors in every match like weapon rng_ storm location_ and weapons other people get.
558466795179081728,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,152,Pump literally can go die_ i was in a shotgun battle today and at the same distance as my enemy_ he got 150 and i got only 100 so i was the one who dies

558468612449632267,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,190,Unfortunately_ i still believe that the best way to win is just the hiding/camping strategy_ unless you’re a god at this game_ getting into consistent fights means you’ll die sooner or later
