560625939697106975,42,Wanna know how to fix the issue on switch?
560626010240974848,2,Ok
560626044458106882,34,First you have to go into settings
560626082986852353,21,On the switch console
560626104164155412,6,Not mc
560626222892187669,75,You have to make sure there is enough memory wherever you have mc installed
560626338717892620,77,If you have an SD card with mc you should look out if the card has free space
560626458612072448,96,If it's installed into the console storage you should see if it has at least 20 GB of free space
560626810719830017,38,<@558683048141652009> that's the issue
560626966986752011,2,No
560627035723137024,17,Only slightly tho
560627195756806145,69,You gotta change some settings if your gonna keep it on system memory
