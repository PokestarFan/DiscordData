558757375713214464,MINECRAFT,skins-n-textures,45,the fact you had the nerve to say that is sad
558758449270358058,MINECRAFT,skins-n-textures,428,the nerve that you had to not only trash my skin because it looked like it was a "guy who would drive a free candy van" is disgusting_ but you somehow never fail to improve_ by attacking people for their pfp's_ how they respond to critisism_ and openly admitting you are doing it for humor. not to mention that your account is under a month old and you don't even bother to act like you are under the legal age to be on discord.
558758760756019230,MINECRAFT,skins-n-textures,82,yep_ i put more time into a response than you put into your entire discord account
