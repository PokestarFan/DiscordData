558447915178393639,69,i used to use https://minecraftcommand.science/command-sign-generator
558447933608165399,18,but it's for 1.8..
558448432352591891,94,does this site allow me to just paste in a code_ or do i have to actualy type in shiet myself?
558449137868079105,209,what if i wanted a sign for ```/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:"minecraft:villager"}}NL/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] money 5```
558449247679414282,48,with 3x ` at the beginning and the end of a text
558449613204488212,64,mhm_ is what i used to have_ i also had nice coloring etc etc...
558450042764001280,28,didn't use to when i had it?
558450124682952705,33,i think i had like tellraw though
558450500165566526,37,I'm not experienced with these things
558450521623625729,25,so i wouldn't know how to
558451533935673355,21,shoouldn't be needed?
558451582543593473,58,all my signs on my old server noone had problems accesing?
558452173885669377,22,well they could anyway
558452430551908362,31,but anyways_ first things first
558452545509654528,544,noone has updated their websites to make something like ```/give @p sign 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"color\":\"blue\"}"_Text2:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:\\"minecraft:villager\\"}}\"}}"_Text3:"{\"text\":\"$ 5_- \"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] money 5\"}}"}_display:{Name:"Custom Sign"}}```
558452706340241418,7,and btw
558452730725793812,29,this is to give "me" the sign
558452736383909928,8,not them
558452786220761098,81,i use a command block to give me the sign and then i hang it op for people to use
558453114579976203,18,they don't have to
558453145693323274,40,the /give is to give me the sign anyways
558453299154518016,13,it's the idea
558454181892194304,7,oh shit
558454249445654528,63,could u possible remove text line 1 and make text line 3 green?
558455340748898325,108,and let's say if i wanted a different color on the same line with a text_ could i just put it infront of it?
558456877046824980,27,tried to put it into text 2
558456935536394256,34,but seems like it's cooperating xD
558457427553419308,33,sorry tried to put it into text 3
558457441998864454,14,let me link it
558457613302366219,513,```/give @p sign{BlockEntityTag:{Text1:""_Text2:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:\\\"minecraft:villager\\\"}}\"}}"_Text3:""[\"\"_{\"text\":\"Red\"_\"color\":\"red\"}_\" \"_{\"text\":\"Blue\"_\"color\":\"blue\"}]"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] money 5\"}}"}_display:{Name:"\"Custom Sign\""}}```

558467345623023616,14,finaly got it!
558467378430869514,21,jesus how complicated
558467698305138719,46,so you agree that once i give myself this sign
558467706920370187,14,and put it out
558467735902748672,39,noone needs commands to click on it ðŸ˜ƒ ?
558468761645088789,70,so without operator permission noone can use it is what you're saying?
558468836093853716,36,now i mean without the /give command
558468949956755466,66,because the command they're basically using is /scoreboard players
558469517299417099,88,i swear to you i've seen people use it and it works_ but i can't test it untill tomorrow
558469569908310025,61,mind me contacting you if it doesn't for a possible solution?
558469623373103126,29,gonna have to go to sleep now
558470058448388126,61,I will try_ you could always leave a reply whenever you can ðŸ˜ƒ
