558462057612181534,general,33,spiderman 3 shatters expectations
558462075433779200,general,46,as it not only gives you the rise of spiderman
558462082706571275,general,17,but also the fall
558462091460214784,general,13,like garfield

558462654943985667,general,34,some people like to talk like that
558462719653707793,general,97,Drop you like to speak in complete thoughts and punctuations_ maybe other people feel differently
558462750930501632,general,28,especially over social media
558462805385412611,general,16,Yeah that's fair

558463304532623360,general,4,shut
558463374091091968,general,70,I don't think you should really mute someone over something subjective
558463396861706260,general,45,If that's how the way they talk then so be it
558463422619058216,general,36,If it's legitimate spam hey go ahead
558463458773827595,general,45,Like saying drop three times in a row is spam
558463491103653899,general,60,but what you just did as an example of how some people speak
558463505989369876,general,35,I still don't think that's spam lol
558463527094976523,general,14,Not really lol

558466648714248193,suggestions,251,"too many mods" how about you try being an admin and come across tons of weird shit that gets uploaded during hours in which most mods aren't online lmao. that's the purpose of certain mods_ it's because they're awake and active during those odd hours

558469517995540510,general,70,the rare occurrence in which drop doesn't fully use proper punctuation
558469597062234113,general,4,Wait
558469606377914399,general,16,Genuine question
558469662182998057,general,11,Makes sense
558469752503402501,general,78,but when you want people to take you seriously you just use proper punctuation
558469773793558558,general,27,+ the fact of the OCD stuff
558469803656871946,general,24,Ok wait genuine question
558469977204719647,general,199,When lgbtq people put stuff like "they/them" are they assuming people are stupid? Like why do you need to specify both they AND them? Why not just use they? Do you think we don't know how words work?
