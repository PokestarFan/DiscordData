558427659693195265,3,Hot
558459579562852367,75,Black Panther is good_ but not as good as most people make it out to be imo
558459631597256704,4,epic
558459983239446540,23,i thought coco was 2017
558461286795706371,19,Shrek released 2001
558461374582489090,9,also yeah
558461397290450945,40,Captain Marvel looks incredibly mediocre
558461443486253065,53,I think I might just skip that and wait till Avengers
558461617579229197,1,?
558461635488907284,4,what
558461751553949716,6,me too
558461843451150347,30,I never watched either Ant Man
558461899935580170,53,as someone who has seen avengers assemble the tv show
558461928758968330,38,I don't think I'll ever watch them lol
558461978536837133,12,origin story
558462004105576468,44,or story of heroes learning to work together
558462057612181534,33,spiderman 3 shatters expectations
558462075433779200,46,as it not only gives you the rise of spiderman
558462082706571275,17,but also the fall
558462091460214784,13,like garfield
558462112058572802,34,spiderman 3 is a film about layers
558462152441200655,12,ill stop now
558462417215029263,30,this man has gone clearly nuts
558462609347837982,66,You're safe now_ but in Spiderman 4 i will shoot you with a pistol
558462654943985667,34,some people like to talk like that
558462719653707793,97,Drop you like to speak in complete thoughts and punctuations_ maybe other people feel differently
558462750930501632,28,especially over social media
558462805385412611,16,Yeah that's fair
558462833504026624,40,I mean I think that there's restrictions
558462899191021598,11,Spiderman 3
558462948532551683,4,link
558463153881743370,81,Friendly reminder that I was boxed for two days for jokingly calling Drop a nonce
558463230159093765,12,Is it though
558463258755858443,12,Is it really
558463270428868618,2,Ok
558463286497247262,34,But other people think differently
558463304532623360,4,shut
558463374091091968,70,I don't think you should really mute someone over something subjective
558463396861706260,45,If that's how the way they talk then so be it
558463422619058216,36,If it's legitimate spam hey go ahead
558463458773827595,45,Like saying drop three times in a row is spam
558463491103653899,60,but what you just did as an example of how some people speak
558463505989369876,35,I still don't think that's spam lol
558463527094976523,14,Not really lol
558463822210531350,7,ok fine
558463861527674890,46,7 uninterrupted messages in less than a minute
558463897271664640,11,that's spam
558463921720262685,33,i still think there's a fine line
558464168483880970,5,Yikes
558464237177929728,22,Well that's subjective
558464249848922122,3,lol
558464291527720971,2,ok
558464296737308702,3,why
558464329368731649,7,my baby
558464551876558878,54,I actually think a lot of people type the way Kim does
558464577319469076,37,maybe not as extreme but to an extent
558469517995540510,70,the rare occurrence in which drop doesn't fully use proper punctuation
558469597062234113,4,Wait
558469606377914399,16,Genuine question
558469662182998057,11,Makes sense
558469752503402501,78,but when you want people to take you seriously you just use proper punctuation
558469773793558558,27,+ the fact of the OCD stuff
558469803656871946,24,Ok wait genuine question
558469977204719647,199,When lgbtq people put stuff like "they/them" are they assuming people are stupid? Like why do you need to specify both they AND them? Why not just use they? Do you think we don't know how words work?
558470034230345738,17,Genuinely curious
558470068799799316,48,I'm not going to call you a she but then say him
558470206922555423,18,I don't understand
558470277831327754,8,It's not
558470287663038474,18,I asked a question
558470324430176278,52,like i was genuinely curious as to why people did it
558470414116978699,20,wait context to what
558470556647686146,5,Ohhhh
