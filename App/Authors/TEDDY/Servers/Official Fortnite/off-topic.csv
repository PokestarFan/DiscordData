558821133642629121,747,Account selling/buying/trading/etc is against the Fortnite Terms of Service that everyone agrees to and signs before playing the game. This is a **bannable** offense both in game and in this Discord.NLNLKeep in mind_ if you buy someone's account_ you are likely **getting scammed**. As the original account creator_ they are likely in possession of significant facts that may enable them to recover the account through our Player Support process (such as transaction history_ address history_ etc.) by claiming you stole the account. Don't waste your money or time_ be smart and be safe.
