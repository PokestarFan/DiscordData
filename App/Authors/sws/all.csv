558447073804943366,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,62,<@556632636295217162> Mercury lmg_ neon sniper_ helium shotgun
558449512218230826,r/teengamingnights,general,16,Theres an event?
558449636378017836,r/teengamingnights,general,5,Ah ok
558449754196148265,r/teengamingnights,general,64,I dont care for 1.8 combat_ its more about who has the best ping
558451244667109376,r/teengamingnights,general,42,Its like releasing a terrorist from prison
558451347234750465,r/teengamingnights,general,76,Hes going to just terrorize and violate the rules without being banned again
558451449894535181,r/teengamingnights,general,76,Im gonna ping the mods and tell them something that they really need to know
558452188905734175,r/teengamingnights,general,51,That theyre really shit with doing what people want
558452281314639884,r/teengamingnights,general,102,I dont think ill waste a ping for the mods but im going to start a google forum for people to fill out
558452462046937088,r/teengamingnights,general,142,So we can get actual DEMOCRACY on this server instead of NSA + mods doing whatever they want the server to be instead of what the players want
558453156950835214,r/teengamingnights,general,114,Im gonna start up a survey on google forums so the mods can know what people want them to do about pvp and the hub
558454619861417984,r/teengamingnights,general,35,I dont think the mods can tell that
558455109399347230,r/teengamingnights,general,76,I feel like the mods need to change the nether hub_ its a shithole as of now
558455187162005531,r/teengamingnights,general,31,The mods hate democracy i guess
558455319697686538,r/teengamingnights,general,93,Well i guess its not all of the mods but i think NSA needs to listen to what the players want
558455403940413480,r/teengamingnights,general,87,The nether hub should be protected from pvp entirely_ and bedbombing should be bannable
558455567434252350,r/teengamingnights,general,59,Its useless since players like theo and o8f camp down there
558455665920704538,r/teengamingnights,general,73,Im pretty sure thats a bannable offense to camp around a place for people
558455970473312260,r/teengamingnights,general,85,Rule 1c. "Witch-hunting_ threatening_ harassment_ and targeting users is not allowed"
558456110701346848,r/teengamingnights,general,50,Not a witch hunt but its more like targeting users
558456194881290242,r/teengamingnights,general,81,I see the free theo supporters threatening people and targeting them all the time
558456954792574997,r/teengamingnights,general,36,Still its pretty close to harassment
558456991924879363,r/teengamingnights,general,53,Since pvp usually comes with insulting and harassment
558457109126184970,r/teengamingnights,general,68,Such as theo saying "get f*cked"_ telling people to "stfu" et cetera
558457185609318402,r/teengamingnights,general,69,It was NSA and his lack of sense of what people want the server to be
558457302513090560,r/teengamingnights,general,41,He just doesnt seem to care for democracy
558457379578970153,r/teengamingnights,general,39,Sorry im just shit at explaining things
558457461678538754,r/teengamingnights,general,62,I know man. Ive lost so much shit to being harassed in the Hub
558457516581847046,r/teengamingnights,general,40,Ive had 3 people on me at once sometimes
558457562215874573,r/teengamingnights,general,43,Its like theyre specifically going after me
558457614204141578,r/teengamingnights,general,57,Technically against the rules but NSA doesnt seem to care
558458069907013632,r/teengamingnights,general,43,Some are good but its NSA thats the problem
558458128455434241,r/teengamingnights,general,43,He just doesnt seem to care about democracy
558458346391339028,r/teengamingnights,general,114,Connor is a good example of a moderator_ he goes in depth with his bans/punishments and does them for good reasons
558458395225489408,r/teengamingnights,general,60,NSA just isnt really there and isnt keen on what people want
558458571688378368,r/teengamingnights,general,125,Considering that lots of people donated i would say the people do have a right to controlling the server at least in some way
558458845169451028,r/teengamingnights,general,48,Really everyone should have a say in how its ran
558458899418578964,r/teengamingnights,general,49,Its democracy and thats how you get a good server
558458994692456479,r/teengamingnights,general,128,If the mods listen and participate in the community and change the server hoe the community wants_ its going to be a good server
558459366626426881,r/teengamingnights,general,73,Right now its still good but it needs a lot of work to how pvp is handled
558459466178363405,r/teengamingnights,general,76,Its more like what hes not doing. I dont think hes managing the server right
558466829681426432,r/teengamingnights,general,102,Tldr_ you dont like the new players in the server and would rather just let the new players get camped
558467860247347210,r/teengamingnights,general,91,The best servers should serve the players first and should change to accomodate the players
558792832379387950,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,23,I think you mean tier 5
558792873852665867,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,31,Tier 6 is unobtainble right now
