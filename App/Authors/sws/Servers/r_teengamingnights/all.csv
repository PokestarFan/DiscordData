558449512218230826,general,16,Theres an event?
558449636378017836,general,5,Ah ok
558449754196148265,general,64,I dont care for 1.8 combat_ its more about who has the best ping
558451244667109376,general,42,Its like releasing a terrorist from prison
558451347234750465,general,76,Hes going to just terrorize and violate the rules without being banned again
558451449894535181,general,76,Im gonna ping the mods and tell them something that they really need to know
558452188905734175,general,51,That theyre really shit with doing what people want
558452281314639884,general,102,I dont think ill waste a ping for the mods but im going to start a google forum for people to fill out
558452462046937088,general,142,So we can get actual DEMOCRACY on this server instead of NSA + mods doing whatever they want the server to be instead of what the players want
558453156950835214,general,114,Im gonna start up a survey on google forums so the mods can know what people want them to do about pvp and the hub
558454619861417984,general,35,I dont think the mods can tell that
558455109399347230,general,76,I feel like the mods need to change the nether hub_ its a shithole as of now
558455187162005531,general,31,The mods hate democracy i guess
558455319697686538,general,93,Well i guess its not all of the mods but i think NSA needs to listen to what the players want
558455403940413480,general,87,The nether hub should be protected from pvp entirely_ and bedbombing should be bannable
558455567434252350,general,59,Its useless since players like theo and o8f camp down there
558455665920704538,general,73,Im pretty sure thats a bannable offense to camp around a place for people
558455970473312260,general,85,Rule 1c. "Witch-hunting_ threatening_ harassment_ and targeting users is not allowed"
558456110701346848,general,50,Not a witch hunt but its more like targeting users
558456194881290242,general,81,I see the free theo supporters threatening people and targeting them all the time
558456954792574997,general,36,Still its pretty close to harassment
558456991924879363,general,53,Since pvp usually comes with insulting and harassment
558457109126184970,general,68,Such as theo saying "get f*cked"_ telling people to "stfu" et cetera
558457185609318402,general,69,It was NSA and his lack of sense of what people want the server to be
558457302513090560,general,41,He just doesnt seem to care for democracy
558457379578970153,general,39,Sorry im just shit at explaining things
558457461678538754,general,62,I know man. Ive lost so much shit to being harassed in the Hub
558457516581847046,general,40,Ive had 3 people on me at once sometimes
558457562215874573,general,43,Its like theyre specifically going after me
558457614204141578,general,57,Technically against the rules but NSA doesnt seem to care
558458069907013632,general,43,Some are good but its NSA thats the problem
558458128455434241,general,43,He just doesnt seem to care about democracy
558458346391339028,general,114,Connor is a good example of a moderator_ he goes in depth with his bans/punishments and does them for good reasons
558458395225489408,general,60,NSA just isnt really there and isnt keen on what people want
558458571688378368,general,125,Considering that lots of people donated i would say the people do have a right to controlling the server at least in some way
558458845169451028,general,48,Really everyone should have a say in how its ran
558458899418578964,general,49,Its democracy and thats how you get a good server
558458994692456479,general,128,If the mods listen and participate in the community and change the server hoe the community wants_ its going to be a good server
558459366626426881,general,73,Right now its still good but it needs a lot of work to how pvp is handled
558459466178363405,general,76,Its more like what hes not doing. I dont think hes managing the server right
558466829681426432,general,102,Tldr_ you dont like the new players in the server and would rather just let the new players get camped
558467860247347210,general,91,The best servers should serve the players first and should change to accomodate the players
