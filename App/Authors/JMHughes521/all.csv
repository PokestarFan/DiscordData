558754884329930782,MINECRAFT,minecraft,160,I don't understand why everyone has to be so negative. Just express your opinion without being pushy ... I like the new textures_ and if you don't_ that's fine!
558755054023213076,MINECRAFT,minecraft,19,I'm not complaining
558755233279246356,MINECRAFT,minecraft,73,Command blocks are cool_ though datapacks to me seem a little complicated
558755568920297472,MINECRAFT,minecraft,53,Because they don't like Minecraft_ or they want views
558755771177893908,MINECRAFT,minecraft,80,hytale is some ripoff if minecraft made by the people who run the server Hypixel
558755870637555712,MINECRAFT,minecraft,44,<@411608425257238538> then why are you here?
558756213852995584,MINECRAFT,minecraft,41,Okay_ who are you guys talking about_ me?
558756970128081024,MINECRAFT,minecraft,298,I would like if they changed the way you start a survival world. Sometimes_ it just feels repetitive. You spawn_ get wood_ hide out during the first night_ and then just mine forever till you get diamonds. THEN you can do stuff. But until that point_ the game feels kind of dull sometimes you know?

558757515807031323,MINECRAFT,minecraft,33,Okay no need to bully me concrete
558757653233401866,MINECRAFT,minecraft,91,I'm not saying that MC overall is repetitve_ I'm saying that in survival_ the start is slow
558757836075827210,MINECRAFT,minecraft,80,If they changed it up_ maybe had some kind of special event_ IDK_ just SOMETHING
558758014530879498,MINECRAFT,minecraft,54,I like the other one better_ but I still find it funny
558758719320621066,MINECRAFT,minecraft,187,It would be interesting if at the beginning of a survival world_ you would like_ wake up. It would be interesting to be lying on the ground_ Eyes flutter open_ and your character gets up.
558758849297776849,MINECRAFT,minecraft,23,the heck. Danny Devito?
558759972037459978,MINECRAFT,minecraft,570,I just feel like the player models need a little more animation I guess. THAT would be interesting. Like the texture wraps for your avatars had an optional space where you could copy the face but with the eyes closed_ and then code it so that every few seconds_ the skin would swap the faces for  split second so it would look like your character blinked or whatever. It sounds KIND of complicated and unneccesary_ but if they added simple things like blinking_ maybe an animation for when your character is idle_ it might make the character appear more alive_ you know.
558760439782178925,MINECRAFT,minecraft,231,Right now_ you look at another play and their eyes just STARE at you_ without blinking. And I don't want a mod because one I've never even INSTALLED one_ and I wouldn't want a TON of animations_ just a few simple player animations.
558761177266651155,MINECRAFT,minecraft,257,When you have a sequel_ it usually means that the previous game or movie had  a story plot that could be expanded. Minecraft doesn't really HAVE a plot (well_ if you don't think of defeating the ender dragon as the end of the story) so it can't GET a sequel
558761605173608448,MINECRAFT,minecraft,90,Well give me an example of a game or movie that doesn't have plot_ but still has a sequel.
558761777274421271,MINECRAFT,minecraft,50,The game ain't broken it doesn't need a new engine
558762025564504093,MINECRAFT,minecraft,40,Why would we still be in the stone ages?
558762141025566720,MINECRAFT,minecraft,59,NOPE it AINT Fortnite aint a sandbox game (except creative)
558762282260103168,MINECRAFT,minecraft,62,I think he means that both Fortnite and Minecraft use building
558762782364008458,MINECRAFT,minecraft,73,Improving is NOT the same thing as fixing <@!251808367368994816>#QuarkMod
558763122240913428,MINECRAFT,minecraft,141,You can improve something that is broken or not broken and you can fix something that is broken_ but you cant fix something that isn't broken
558763492266737685,MINECRAFT,minecraft,26,Yes but words have effects
558763658524622848,MINECRAFT,minecraft,72,Literally the least creative comeback ANYONE can come up with is  "no u"
558763792612327445,MINECRAFT,minecraft,27,I havent even said anything
