560639887838150666,MINECRAFT,beta-n-bugs,341,hello people ðŸ˜ƒ Anyone know about sitting cats which stand up after a while and teleport to the player. Its happening to me on the latest snapshot 19w12a but has also been happening on the past few snapshots. looked it up and apparently its been happening in Minecraft for a long time_ maybe something to do with chunks loading and unloading?
560644762466648066,MINECRAFT,support,59,<@195294392079220738> Have you tried restarting the server?
560645340932603934,MINECRAFT,support,67,I'm unsure i just got on here myself_ it may just be a snapshot bug
560646218632527893,MINECRAFT,builds,33,you on pc? check your recycle bin
560646707914735616,MINECRAFT,support,197,here is a wiki page on creating a server_ it should be up to date for 1.12.2 but it does advise some knowledge before starting a server https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Setting_up_a_server
560647264700203039,MINECRAFT,support,27,the mobs are still spawning
560647442866110524,MINECRAFT,support,30,thats a server issue i believe
560648623264759820,MINECRAFT,support,31,Malwarebytes is a great program
560649156343889920,MINECRAFT,support,44,ooo they've updated the website_ looks fancy
560649532204122113,MINECRAFT,support,41,the snapshot probably messed up something
560649953685405723,MINECRAFT,support,109,I have the same issue_ I had the bad omen effect 24/7 because they keep spawning about every 2 Minecraft days
560650079367725056,MINECRAFT,support,42,I think they naturally spawn near villages
560650366576754708,MINECRAFT,support,350,"n Java Edition_ pillagers can spawn in illager patrols. Illager patrols spawn a maximum of five pillagers (weight 55) or vindicators (weight 27) up to 200 blocks away from a village on grass or sand with a block light level of 0â€“8 and a sky light level of 10â€“15. Illager patrols spawn naturally throughout the day or night but after 5 in-game days."
560650562824306719,MINECRAFT,support,77,check if there is a villages 200 blocks away if not its probably a server bug
560651193072746496,MINECRAFT,support,48,https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pillager_outpost
560651320999149569,MINECRAFT,support,93,maybe destroying an outpost if there is one might help but it doesnt offically say anywhere ðŸ˜›
560651817566863370,MINECRAFT,support,14,thanks whoms ðŸ˜›
560651983527346206,MINECRAFT,support,49,yeah when it comes to snapshots servers are buggy
560653040114466845,MINECRAFT,support,119,although for playstation I believe they plan to remove gift codes from shops so offical playstation store in the future
560653496471519232,MINECRAFT,support,133,I think it may be implemented_ if not its always something you could leave as a suggestion at https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us
560653736087912458,MINECRAFT,support,28,im sure they have it planned
560653789414162443,MINECRAFT,support,38,There is no way to stop them attacking
560653824759431178,MINECRAFT,support,13,too true haha
560654442509238313,MINECRAFT,support,14,yeah many bugs
560654468195155979,MINECRAFT,support,22,its snapshot after all
560654657714782208,MINECRAFT,support,102,worst case scenario you will have to create your main server world in an official game release version
