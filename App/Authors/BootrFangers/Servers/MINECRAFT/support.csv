560645340932603934,67,I'm unsure i just got on here myself_ it may just be a snapshot bug
560646707914735616,197,here is a wiki page on creating a server_ it should be up to date for 1.12.2 but it does advise some knowledge before starting a server https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Setting_up_a_server
560647264700203039,27,the mobs are still spawning
560647442866110524,30,thats a server issue i believe
560648623264759820,31,Malwarebytes is a great program
560649156343889920,44,ooo they've updated the website_ looks fancy
560649532204122113,41,the snapshot probably messed up something
560649953685405723,109,I have the same issue_ I had the bad omen effect 24/7 because they keep spawning about every 2 Minecraft days
560650079367725056,42,I think they naturally spawn near villages
560650366576754708,350,"n Java Edition_ pillagers can spawn in illager patrols. Illager patrols spawn a maximum of five pillagers (weight 55) or vindicators (weight 27) up to 200 blocks away from a village on grass or sand with a block light level of 0â€“8 and a sky light level of 10â€“15. Illager patrols spawn naturally throughout the day or night but after 5 in-game days."
560650562824306719,77,check if there is a villages 200 blocks away if not its probably a server bug

560651320999149569,93,maybe destroying an outpost if there is one might help but it doesnt offically say anywhere ðŸ˜›
560651817566863370,14,thanks whoms ðŸ˜›
560651983527346206,49,yeah when it comes to snapshots servers are buggy
560653040114466845,119,although for playstation I believe they plan to remove gift codes from shops so offical playstation store in the future
560653496471519232,133,I think it may be implemented_ if not its always something you could leave as a suggestion at https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us
