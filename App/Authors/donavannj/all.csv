558446786465759252,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,14,idk about best
558446924139593730,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,79,actually wait it is a proxy buy service not just a proxy ship service_ correct?
558447326880858113,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,84,you *may* be able to get away with a forwarding service if you buy through amazon.jp
558447425174503424,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,116,actually make even be able to get away with just straight up buying it through amazon.jp if it's sold by Amazon iirc
558447790699839488,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,116,any should work_ but the ones people I know have used or that I've used myself are DEJAPAN_ FromJapan_ and ZenMarket
558447888775118858,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,35,ZenMarket tends to have higher fees
558448186075643904,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,26,depends on the proxy buyer
558448295333199912,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,44,my guess is probably under $30 easily though
558448328384315403,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,18,probably even less
558448399087566849,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,64,gimme a sec while I go look up my fees for my last zenmarket buy
558448807738867713,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,57,okay yeah i paid 300 yen per item purchased in commission
558449062295240704,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,3,yep
558449086148116480,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,34,shipping to zen market was 324 yen
558449158378487809,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,47,shipping to me was EMS only due to package size
558449197536509968,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,33,3700 yen because it was nesoberis
558449213185196033,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,3,yes
558449244218982401,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,22,Minnesota specifically
558449425714905088,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,63,all the services should be able to work with a link you provide
558449435160477710,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,18,and order the item
558449518488846346,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,37,that's what i had to do with my items
558449688022351882,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,107,they will tell you if the retailer doesn't like selling to proxy buy services iirc_ usually by email though
558449825826209813,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,108,here's your item page link: http://shop.tsutaya.co.jp/dvd/product/4515778101263/?sc_int=dvd_pc_center-pickup
558450395555299341,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,41,it's looking for you to describe the item
558450445073514497,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,63,to ensure they get the right thing when they go shopping for it
558450565810749451,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,48,and then you click add to add it to the buy list
558450787555213355,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,62,they will check item availability overnight and then email you
558450971164803083,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,8,yeah lol
558451062080798721,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,78,completely missed the signs you hadn't signed upNLNLNLuh not that i can think of?
558451122755469362,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,70,i signed up with one back in the fall but i've completely forgotten it
558451272022228992,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,38,it was only a 300 yen promotion anyway
558451306088497172,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,36,also zenmarket works by adding funds
558451362497822720,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,69,and i think there's a fee for converting your cash to zenmarket funds
558451407372419082,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,52,so that's part of why people don't use it as readily
558451536418701322,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,86,i used zenmarket because the items i wanted had a capped purchase quantity per address
558451909652905994,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,81,iircNLNLthough i'm not seeing any fund add fees in my payment history on my account
558451944805367820,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,36,so I *could* be remembering it wrong
558452077320470538,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,77,i haven't used the other two services so i'm not sure how *they* work in full
558452121876430878,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,51,but there's not much I've had to actually proxy buy
558452232358461487,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,95,mostly only forwarding and the things I've bought via forwarding started getting stocked by TOM
558452602732281868,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,29,actually i forgot about Buyee
558452741102632960,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,121,i think  most people i chat with on other servers use Buyee first_ then check DEJAPAN_ then FromJapan_ and then ZenMarket
558452793116065813,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,45,check out the fees for each before committing
558453203545489419,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,64,if zenmarket's your only option_ then that's the way things roll
558453268301479938,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,31,there isn't one on the homepage
558453670329450519,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,23,okay buyee has a plugin
558453690906705931,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,19,called add to buyee
558453750490988545,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,44,and that's how you do the buying apparently?
558453944830132232,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,44,at least for sites not on their list already
558454395197456394,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,111,just tested and that works for tsutayaNLNLso that's good newsNLNLhappy shoppingNLNLdon't destroy your wallet too hard
558769412690280471,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,89,i'd stick to just using Nippon-Yasan for old figures you can't find elsewhere_ personally
