560638617937117185,295,Hey java peeps_ im pretty new with learning about DATA packs and BEHAVIOR packs -- This guy made a custom mob with a BEHAVIOR Pack; How possible is it to do this in java? The entity does not override an exisiting one. it has its own AI and spawner egg.NLhttps://mcpedl.com/spyro-the-dragon-addon/
560638868647575563,65,<@!209861974102638592> possible in 1.14 with CustomModelData ^^ ?

560639086113718292,42,So no armor remodels coming to 1.14 either
560639250240897044,147,Lorks I was looking into making a vanilla custom mob like this behavior pack_ was wondering if there was something in the API to call for a new one
560639332587798559,33,yeah ive tried that_ bad idea lol
560639349989834753,24,too much lag on a server
560639397800837130,44,the armorstand doesnt precise location do it
560639767407099904,66,Right so im probably just gonna have to rely on optifine JPM files
560639803616657438,31,so semi-modded client side mobs
560639850857103371,69,Can remodel them with nbt tags but no custom AI like this spyro thing
