558455736707842048,568,the marketplace texture pack "odyssey: the sci-fi resource pack" which I bought only minutes after having the 1.10 update thrust upon my switch has a critical problem causing a seemingly randomized obkext to render around my character obsucring all vision whenever I look in the direction of specific entities_ making it unplayable. Also_ its's selling point (a custom music pack) doesn't work at all_ meaning no music in minecraft ever. Is this a 1.10 thing_ a Switch thing_ or a broken store item that somehow managed to get rated super highly before becoming a dud?
