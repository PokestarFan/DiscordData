560641059005399061,71,Combustion is pretty strong anyway since you cant counter the explosion
560641237464383488,89,unless they nerfed the time to combust you have to predict the combust to stop it in time
560642249327902731,131,I mean considering you have <1 sec to counter the combustion_ you need to be pretty fast and having any latency makes it impossible
