560640986729152543,83,I mean they arent going to not play a card when its only has one bugged interaction
560641059005399061,71,Combustion is pretty strong anyway since you cant counter the explosion
560641237464383488,89,unless they nerfed the time to combust you have to predict the combust to stop it in time
560642249327902731,131,I mean considering you have <1 sec to counter the combustion_ you need to be pretty fast and having any latency makes it impossible
560642813356933132,132,you may not know this but every card has a .5 second delay before its playedNLand black hole has a 1 second delay before it activates
560642864493625344,56,combust activated after 1.5 seconds and explodes after 1
560642888376254494,14,you have 1 sec
560643019926405132,71,is it hard_ nah but for people with higher latency it can be impossible
560643519962677259,85,you would probably need an outside program since I dont this /showstats has that info
560643736023990272,93,but you can be matched up against people from any region so latency can be high in some cases
560643851862147075,51,huh they mightve changed it or im remembering wrong
560643887753068574,34,ill ask fdm if its still available
560643945319759902,16,you can do /help
560643958527754241,21,but ti doesnt have it
