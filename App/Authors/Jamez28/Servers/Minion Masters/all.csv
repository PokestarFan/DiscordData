560602543651291137,deckbuilding,68,5 sec divine shield_ priestess at 30/hps_ for a whopping 150 healing
560602572390531083,deckbuilding,3,nah
560602610332205067,deckbuilding,26,hold Azali and BBB in hand
560602626904031232,deckbuilding,10,free value
560602673133649931,deckbuilding,41,Better yet just hold BBB and play it at 0
560602703789817856,deckbuilding,41,0 mana every mana you spend summons a bat
560602769275355137,deckbuilding,11,pretty much
560602873524912130,deckbuilding,95,its pretty hard to beat a 0 mana BBB into say a 5 mana Azali into another 5 mana worth of stuff
560603025664901146,deckbuilding,95,the wet dream is 0 mana BBB into 0 Mana Azali into Morgruls Ragers_ and some other 5 mana cards
560627544383291414,minion_masters_general,24,contrary to what you saw
560627563152539648,minion_masters_general,23,datenshi lost that game
560629476153884672,suggestions,26,how many wins were you at?
560630763348033537,suggestions,67,yeah its almost a guarentee you run into the same guy after 8+ wins
560630832369369090,suggestions,61,the system tries to find someone else at 8 then 7_ then 6 etc
560630908516958223,suggestions,71,so if no one else is in draft its really easy to run into the same dude
560638693342445571,minion_masters_general,48,all fun and games till you run into 2x memestorm
560639945245589505,minion_masters_general,2,2x
560640074027630592,minion_masters_general,11,1800>2000 ðŸ¤”
560640986729152543,minion_masters_general,83,I mean they arent going to not play a card when its only has one bugged interaction
560641059005399061,minion_masters_general,71,Combustion is pretty strong anyway since you cant counter the explosion
560641237464383488,minion_masters_general,89,unless they nerfed the time to combust you have to predict the combust to stop it in time
560642249327902731,minion_masters_general,131,I mean considering you have <1 sec to counter the combustion_ you need to be pretty fast and having any latency makes it impossible
560642813356933132,minion_masters_general,132,you may not know this but every card has a .5 second delay before its playedNLand black hole has a 1 second delay before it activates
560642864493625344,minion_masters_general,56,combust activated after 1.5 seconds and explodes after 1
560642888376254494,minion_masters_general,14,you have 1 sec
560643019926405132,minion_masters_general,71,is it hard_ nah but for people with higher latency it can be impossible
560643519962677259,minion_masters_general,85,you would probably need an outside program since I dont this /showstats has that info
560643736023990272,minion_masters_general,93,but you can be matched up against people from any region so latency can be high in some cases
560643851862147075,minion_masters_general,51,huh they mightve changed it or im remembering wrong
