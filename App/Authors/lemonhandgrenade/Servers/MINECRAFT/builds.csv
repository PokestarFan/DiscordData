558791877667586058,29,Can you help me with shaders?
558792067178823680,28,You can't if you're level >4
558792216814813184,209,So I've got a wheat model where at age 7 it becomes a 2 block high model but with shader the 2 blocks break the only fix I've is put wheat under leaves but that makes the whole thing move up and down any help?
558792579295084561,9,Oh oof ok
558792768118587392,72,It very small and hardly noticeable but my ocd just rages at it existing
