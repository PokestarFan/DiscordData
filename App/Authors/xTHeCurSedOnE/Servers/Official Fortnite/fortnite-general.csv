558858368689897485,8,Hi Megan
558858546025070594,23,I create Fortnite maps.
558858832323936262,125,PvP apocalyptic type of maps. Destruction_ debris_ fire_ broken buildings and bridges. Car blockades_ just chaos pretty much.
558859273975758849,170,<@242749069733134336> My maps are almost always enclosed with barriers and death barriers to keep players inside the map. I don't really like doing anything largely open.
558859816706244620,199,I test my own maps for glitches and I am pretty damn good at keeping players where I want them. If there is a glitch then it's something totally not expected but I'll just go in and patch the glitch.
558860227659694080,228,I actually enjoy fun glitches! If I admire how someone does a glitch in one of my maps I might actually keep it on purpose. Sometimes I even create intentional "glitch spots" so players can explore the outside bounds of the map.
558860651976720394,85,Yes_ so long as it isn't game-breaking such as a sky barrier spot or invincible area.
558860833925496842,93,I currently don't have a code_ but if you added me on Epic I could invite you to it that way.
