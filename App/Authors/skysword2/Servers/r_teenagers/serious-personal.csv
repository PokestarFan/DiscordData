558440383739068429,59,i'm sure you'd rather be a human than a gazelle for example
558440436159610901,68,cause iof you were a gazelle you'd just get your ass eaten by a lion
558440446511284225,21,thats not much better

558440952562188288,32,just like learn to adapt i guess
558440970849615889,37,going anprim isn't gonna fix anything
558441121584381988,44,i mean you said the kid was your best friend
558441167218409503,42,so like you;re prolly steady on that front
558441195634819075,31,literally punch him in the face
558441271543332888,3,oof
558441295815770122,37,you left the server and didn't rejoin
558441306725154820,22,so your metric is gone
558441661194305539,48,i mean like real talk i'd just deadass fight him
558441672749481985,26,or confront him either way
558441729846673436,21,nigga lay his ass out
558441792593461259,51,if a dude is being a bitch ass im gonna lay him out
558441840983015447,35,thats just reality of the situation
558441877855141899,4,word
558441902848999427,23,your dad is hella smart
558441970503254027,99,he's definitely insecure but real talk is he's not gonna change that with anyone's help but his own
558442021828821003,36,that man needs to get his ass kicked
558442032163586088,20,and then he'll learn
558442058952474653,18,thats life lessons
558442090875584513,50,the best lessons are taught through an ass beating
558442098068684821,11,except math
558442120294432770,41,math is not taught well with ass beatings
558442171183923200,19,not if he's a bitch
558442313907699713,80,if he's a mark ass nigga real talk if you even threaten to fight him it will end
558442387777519641,104,like literally walk up to him and be like "if you want to do this i want thirty seconds with you outside
558442406220136448,20,and see what he says
558442420128448553,21,90% shot he backs off
558442447995404299,38,10% shot you have to lay his ass *out*
558442494829002752,29,either way he's gonna be gone
558442598910525472,49,is it p[ossible you're using a little bit of bias
558442751381995530,146,i feel like the vast majority of people on here are so biased against the people they don't like that they end up looking like comic book villains
558442806037839882,44,like if he's that bad just fight him already
558443131343863809,18,idon't hate anyone
558443201694793728,124,like real talk the idea of letting somebody you don't even fucking like take up any of your time is fucking ridiculous to me
558443227053817856,33,like it's actually fucking absurd
558443258124959764,68,imagine spending your time being angry about something you can't fix
558443294401626132,33,like either fix it or get over it
558443319760388108,32,stewing just gets you more angry
558443357265854533,40,kids being a dick? punch him in the face
558443372008701982,27,or let him burn himself out
558443389360537600,18,truth always tells
558443403692605452,25,and humans aren't all bad
558443427772235776,30,you learn that as time goes on
558443455236538369,41,majority of humans are law abiding people
558443545938100236,28,so you don't let the hate in
558443552422625282,6,at all
558443568931536896,29,then you don't need an outlet
558443605388427275,7,it does
558443624715780237,43,you are allowing them to occupy brain space
558443636371750922,7,so stop
558443663299051532,37,just stop thinking about this personm
558443679036211253,28,its a lesson learned in time
558443764138639370,69,i mean as a teenager its really easy to get mad about stupid shit tbh
558443851723833358,106,i almost punched a hole in my wall like last year because i found out i got fucked over by my chem teacher
558443902634295337,33,immediate anger is understandable
558443915439505409,21,long term anger isn't
558444076006113301,33,i spend so much fucking time here
558444081148067851,10,its unreal
558444368269410324,19,how old are you zam
558444396543213590,8,like 15?
558444407515250689,14,it does matter
558444422585647115,21,it absolutely matters
558444481754431518,18,you've lived about
558444494542995477,22,and this is optimistic
558444514654683157,29,about 20 percent of your life
558444548498391040,37,which means you've still got 80% left
558444575102992396,37,that is 80% of people you haven't met
558444603770929180,34,80% of experiences you haven't had
558444621366296597,18,its generally true
558444664932401173,16,you get one life
558444682649272340,31,and i cannot stress this enough
558444707760439317,37,you will die within the next 70 yeras
558444753809702923,8,okay yes
558444786529337346,28,but thats not exactly common
558444815755509771,18,so why plan for it
558444855886610445,42,you are yet to experience 80% of your life
558444868213538828,18,so go out and live
558444904343404566,51,stop getting absorbed in bullshit high school drama
558444926052859914,41,none of this shit will matter in 10 years
558444937134473227,12,much less 50
558444983515086870,51,so in 50 years when you're retired with your family
558445013801893898,56,you don't want to be thinking "i fucking wasted my time"
558445027928309781,33,and that is what you are doing rn
558445036791005253,17,wasting your time
558445047796727825,25,so stop wasting your time
558445208921047060,68,mate high school is an integral experience for the rest of your life
558445233461919755,49,like you sound like an edgy 13 year old right now
558445271873486849,47,you still have soooo fucking much to experience
558445288432599050,19,like why generalize
558445330488623104,61,why assume that like the rest of your life is gonna be shitty
558445373400809513,34,i mean real talk i'd buy zam is 13
558445391347974155,25,zam are you neurotypical?
558445468137553950,14,college is ass
558445487280357387,31,unless you go to a party school
558445498545995814,17,i wanna go to FSU
558445514199400448,20,full send university
558445567903137793,21,definitely definitely
558445598500454400,33,but also connections and branding
558445636400447498,35,partying is a vital part of college
558445669338054676,42,thats where you branch out and meet people
558445686773776425,33,IT is packed with depressed nerds
558445734408617985,54,who are all heavy smokers out in california and oregon
558445762409660431,13,yeah but like
558445766147047424,4,weed
558445847906484225,19,zam nothing matters
558445882287194112,30,like literally nothing matters
558445911051730996,63,so saying that something doesn't matter is a bullshit statement
558445942114877451,47,its gonna make your life easier in the long run
558445961698082817,36,so you can do shit you want to later
558445976012980226,22,you can drop out at 16
558445990944833539,18,run away from home
558446032980279300,28,you can do whatever you want
558446049942044676,22,the world is free roam
558446072738086912,13,okay so what?
558446091968839721,24,you hate everyone anyway
558446134016606208,25,so make it bussing tables
558446151041548299,34,get illegal under the counter jobs
558446164870037518,17,its not difficult
558446210902392847,33,go to a homeless outreach program
558446227415629838,22,go to a student school
558446255244705793,13,halfway homes
558446295317086218,33,mate you have options is my point
558446334529503263,31,i promise this is the best path
558446353454465024,35,but if you don't want to pursue it?
558446363998683151,14,thats fine too
558446388208336897,47,you can literally do whatever the fuck you want
558446437222973441,47,and the only thing stopping you is other people
558446505820815390,27,he;s not gonna do anything]
558446627208167445,50,i've literally been in this exact situation before
558446682761854986,94,when i was 13 i threw a shit fit because i didn't need social studies or english to go into IT
558446710494593051,31,i got all angry and did nothing
558446728643084288,31,and now im getting my CS degree
558446764160581633,58,because i learned sometimes life isn't about what you want
558446828564250645,15,not necessarily
558446856930328596,50,i could've gone my entire life without shakespeare
558446885333893120,45,still don't ever think im gonna use that shit
558446921677668362,24,math is pretty important
558447000048238594,93,i'd say the most important life skills i learned were from social shit outside of high school
558447027793690637,23,parties and experiences
558447040644907019,14,shit like that
558447060958052353,37,i learned how to interact with people
558447193359646732,36,you can learn how to do taxes online
558447237206769675,21,turbo tax all the way
558447286837968897,40,i don't think they're completely useless
558447306429562881,30,but Ap english lit was useless
558447326369284097,24,i didn't need that class
558447372431130642,52,i think english past like 8th grade is kinda useless
558447394870525983,43,its mostly just reading american literature
558447448595496999,18,and MLA formatting
558447583132123156,68,i mean reading comprehension is a pretty youngly learned skil though
558447622189481984,67,and dissecting harder writing is different than reading old english
558447634197643264,23,old english is dog shit
558447646973624336,26,and i learned nada from it
558447715865067530,103,and the fact that people lack it is good evidence that its an inefficient piece of the education system
558447826464407562,97,like i think that they're good for people that have interest in going into those types of careers
558447891253821459,48,like being interested is different than learning
558447933662560258,49,AP english lit taught me nothing that i use today
558448011307647030,87,i think the last english class where i learned something that i use daily was english 9
558448043448467466,35,where i learned to use MLA citation
558448182745366548,107,i mean making music mandatory makes just about as much sense as making social studies and english mandatory
558448207055814686,41,i think a holistic education is important
558448283098415105,50,but also i never use anything i learned in history
558448295064633347,14,until AP world
558448323242229760,36,which was when essay writing started
558448461452673029,16,its good to know
558448486144802857,55,but i also think technology application is good to know
558448539424915457,78,like i think its important that people need to learn how to read computer code
558448547565928470,17,most people can't
558448576825655324,63,reading and writing and listening and speaking are vital skills
558448584417214482,12,core pillars
558448625609605126,58,most of that is knocked compeletely down by like 8th grade
558449027356688384,60,i mean imagine forcing kids to learn how to read shakespeare
558449051289387023,32,old english is fucking backwards
558449296895377429,17,no doubt no doubt
558449317216649226,40,but i don't need to read him to get that
558449330634227732,25,its not vitally important
558449346044231724,33,its just good information to have
558449365828501524,20,its like cool trivia
558449449504866304,74,being cool and being vital are two completely different facets of learning
558449467632910356,28,cool shit should be optional
558449513405087744,30,i think that chemistry is cool
558449530987610112,30,i think earth science is vital
558449572926586891,22,living environment too
558449727440683029,87,i think its unnecessary to stress aspects of education that aren't completely necessary
558449755278016512,38,or things that aren't going to be used
558449914565230604,46,i don't see why i need to read his book though
558450061760004108,55,i think broadening your perspectives should be optional
558450156626771988,110,it is using up time you could be spending on things that are more important for your specialized career choice
558450196565196801,8,disagree
558450225581391872,13,also disagree
558450235563704321,17,some people don't
558450249782394901,14,some people do
558450411510431744,66,if you don't know what you want to do you should have the *option*
558450421492875268,14,hence optional
558450479252635649,56,it shouldn't be mandatory but the choice should be there
558450799206989855,53,swo then they should be allowed to take those classes
558450870854090752,60,you should have an apprentice understanding of most subjects
558450935777460255,82,but why would you attain a college level understanding of a subject you don't need
558450953972350976,20,it serves no purpose
558451047375568921,14,thats not true
558451084373262354,51,AP classes are the scourge of american high schools
558451130615726080,41,i have to take anthro in freshman college
558451150148599838,33,im not gonna be an anthropologist
558451190615113748,42,im not getting a degree in social sciences
558451215554445313,33,change the education system lmfao
558451338720313357,126,like the american education system was literally modeled after a system they used in nazi germany to create strong SS soldiers
558451378301960202,32,modern education system at least
558451456429129740,22,lemme source that shit
558451920948428810,39,<@!381381785499729920> yeah that was it
558452126699880464,32,i think tech should be mandatory
558452143703588885,21,if everything else is
558452194966503440,47,student's should learn how to work with a trade
558452258543763506,22,hand work is important
558452347731443713,26,im not averse to learning\
558452372859518987,45,i am averse to learning shit i don't need tho
558452506171015168,39,nah i;ve gotten past that at this point
558452566246162432,67,like i just gotta take some pretty bs freshman year college courses
558452616355381258,39,and then its all Comp sci and cyber sec
558452797482205185,84,i was gonna do applied math and then i was like damn i literally fucking hate myself
558452911168946186,30,my dad wanted me to do biotech
558452957956276234,51,sports and physical activity are insanely important
558452973701693451,23,but gym doesn't do shit
558452998687293461,42,nobody actually works out in any gym class
558453047303602216,35,like you have like 7 or 8 try hards
558453145576144936,29,robotics is kinda interesting
558453158209126400,21,its also kinda boring
558453210847641600,43,oh the hofstra regional for NY is coming up
558453215646056451,7,for FRC
558453229663420417,14,i was gonna go
