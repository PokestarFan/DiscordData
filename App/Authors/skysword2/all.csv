558444815755509771,r/teenagers,serious-personal,18,so why plan for it
558444855886610445,r/teenagers,serious-personal,42,you are yet to experience 80% of your life
558444868213538828,r/teenagers,serious-personal,18,so go out and live

558444926052859914,r/teenagers,serious-personal,41,none of this shit will matter in 10 years
558444937134473227,r/teenagers,serious-personal,12,much less 50
558444983515086870,r/teenagers,serious-personal,51,so in 50 years when you're retired with your family
558445013801893898,r/teenagers,serious-personal,56,you don't want to be thinking "i fucking wasted my time"
558445027928309781,r/teenagers,serious-personal,33,and that is what you are doing rn
558445036791005253,r/teenagers,serious-personal,17,wasting your time
558445047796727825,r/teenagers,serious-personal,25,so stop wasting your time
558445208921047060,r/teenagers,serious-personal,68,mate high school is an integral experience for the rest of your life

558445288432599050,r/teenagers,serious-personal,19,like why generalize
558445330488623104,r/teenagers,serious-personal,61,why assume that like the rest of your life is gonna be shitty
558445373400809513,r/teenagers,serious-personal,34,i mean real talk i'd buy zam is 13
558445391347974155,r/teenagers,serious-personal,25,zam are you neurotypical?

558445487280357387,r/teenagers,serious-personal,31,unless you go to a party school
558445498545995814,r/teenagers,serious-personal,17,i wanna go to FSU

558445567903137793,r/teenagers,serious-personal,21,definitely definitely
558445598500454400,r/teenagers,serious-personal,33,but also connections and branding
558445636400447498,r/teenagers,serious-personal,35,partying is a vital part of college
558445669338054676,r/teenagers,serious-personal,42,thats where you branch out and meet people
558445686773776425,r/teenagers,serious-personal,33,IT is packed with depressed nerds
558445734408617985,r/teenagers,serious-personal,54,who are all heavy smokers out in california and oregon
558445762409660431,r/teenagers,serious-personal,13,yeah but like
558445766147047424,r/teenagers,serious-personal,4,weed

558445882287194112,r/teenagers,serious-personal,30,like literally nothing matters
558445911051730996,r/teenagers,serious-personal,63,so saying that something doesn't matter is a bullshit statement
558445942114877451,r/teenagers,serious-personal,47,its gonna make your life easier in the long run
558445961698082817,r/teenagers,serious-personal,36,so you can do shit you want to later
558445976012980226,r/teenagers,serious-personal,22,you can drop out at 16
558445990944833539,r/teenagers,serious-personal,18,run away from home
558446032980279300,r/teenagers,serious-personal,28,you can do whatever you want

558446164870037518,r/teenagers,serious-personal,17,its not difficult
558446210902392847,r/teenagers,serious-personal,33,go to a homeless outreach program
558446227415629838,r/teenagers,serious-personal,22,go to a student school
558446255244705793,r/teenagers,serious-personal,13,halfway homes
558446295317086218,r/teenagers,serious-personal,33,mate you have options is my point
558446334529503263,r/teenagers,serious-personal,31,i promise this is the best path
558446353454465024,r/teenagers,serious-personal,35,but if you don't want to pursue it?
558446363998683151,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,thats fine too
558446388208336897,r/teenagers,serious-personal,47,you can literally do whatever the fuck you want
558446437222973441,r/teenagers,serious-personal,47,and the only thing stopping you is other people
558446505820815390,r/teenagers,serious-personal,27,he;s not gonna do anything]
558446627208167445,r/teenagers,serious-personal,50,i've literally been in this exact situation before
558446682761854986,r/teenagers,serious-personal,94,when i was 13 i threw a shit fit because i didn't need social studies or english to go into IT
558446710494593051,r/teenagers,serious-personal,31,i got all angry and did nothing
558446728643084288,r/teenagers,serious-personal,31,and now im getting my CS degree
558446764160581633,r/teenagers,serious-personal,58,because i learned sometimes life isn't about what you want
558446828564250645,r/teenagers,serious-personal,15,not necessarily
558446856930328596,r/teenagers,serious-personal,50,i could've gone my entire life without shakespeare
558446885333893120,r/teenagers,serious-personal,45,still don't ever think im gonna use that shit
558446921677668362,r/teenagers,serious-personal,24,math is pretty important
558447000048238594,r/teenagers,serious-personal,93,i'd say the most important life skills i learned were from social shit outside of high school
558447027793690637,r/teenagers,serious-personal,23,parties and experiences
558447040644907019,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,shit like that
558447060958052353,r/teenagers,serious-personal,37,i learned how to interact with people
558447193359646732,r/teenagers,serious-personal,36,you can learn how to do taxes online
558447237206769675,r/teenagers,serious-personal,21,turbo tax all the way
558447286837968897,r/teenagers,serious-personal,40,i don't think they're completely useless
558447306429562881,r/teenagers,serious-personal,30,but Ap english lit was useless
558447326369284097,r/teenagers,serious-personal,24,i didn't need that class
558447372431130642,r/teenagers,serious-personal,52,i think english past like 8th grade is kinda useless
558447394870525983,r/teenagers,serious-personal,43,its mostly just reading american literature
558447448595496999,r/teenagers,serious-personal,18,and MLA formatting
558447583132123156,r/teenagers,serious-personal,68,i mean reading comprehension is a pretty youngly learned skil though
558447622189481984,r/teenagers,serious-personal,67,and dissecting harder writing is different than reading old english
558447634197643264,r/teenagers,serious-personal,23,old english is dog shit
558447646973624336,r/teenagers,serious-personal,26,and i learned nada from it
558447715865067530,r/teenagers,serious-personal,103,and the fact that people lack it is good evidence that its an inefficient piece of the education system
558447826464407562,r/teenagers,serious-personal,97,like i think that they're good for people that have interest in going into those types of careers
558447891253821459,r/teenagers,serious-personal,48,like being interested is different than learning
558447933662560258,r/teenagers,serious-personal,49,AP english lit taught me nothing that i use today
558448011307647030,r/teenagers,serious-personal,87,i think the last english class where i learned something that i use daily was english 9
558448043448467466,r/teenagers,serious-personal,35,where i learned to use MLA citation
558448182745366548,r/teenagers,serious-personal,107,i mean making music mandatory makes just about as much sense as making social studies and english mandatory
558448207055814686,r/teenagers,serious-personal,41,i think a holistic education is important
558448283098415105,r/teenagers,serious-personal,50,but also i never use anything i learned in history
558448295064633347,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,until AP world
558448323242229760,r/teenagers,serious-personal,36,which was when essay writing started
558448461452673029,r/teenagers,serious-personal,16,its good to know
558448486144802857,r/teenagers,serious-personal,55,but i also think technology application is good to know
558448539424915457,r/teenagers,serious-personal,78,like i think its important that people need to learn how to read computer code
558448547565928470,r/teenagers,serious-personal,17,most people can't
558448576825655324,r/teenagers,serious-personal,63,reading and writing and listening and speaking are vital skills
558448584417214482,r/teenagers,serious-personal,12,core pillars
558448625609605126,r/teenagers,serious-personal,58,most of that is knocked compeletely down by like 8th grade
558449027356688384,r/teenagers,serious-personal,60,i mean imagine forcing kids to learn how to read shakespeare
558449051289387023,r/teenagers,serious-personal,32,old english is fucking backwards
558449296895377429,r/teenagers,serious-personal,17,no doubt no doubt

558449365828501524,r/teenagers,serious-personal,20,its like cool trivia
558449449504866304,r/teenagers,serious-personal,74,being cool and being vital are two completely different facets of learning
558449467632910356,r/teenagers,serious-personal,28,cool shit should be optional
558449513405087744,r/teenagers,serious-personal,30,i think that chemistry is cool
558449530987610112,r/teenagers,serious-personal,30,i think earth science is vital

558449727440683029,r/teenagers,serious-personal,87,i think its unnecessary to stress aspects of education that aren't completely necessary
558449755278016512,r/teenagers,serious-personal,38,or things that aren't going to be used
558449914565230604,r/teenagers,serious-personal,46,i don't see why i need to read his book though
558450061760004108,r/teenagers,serious-personal,55,i think broadening your perspectives should be optional
558450156626771988,r/teenagers,serious-personal,110,it is using up time you could be spending on things that are more important for your specialized career choice
558450196565196801,r/teenagers,serious-personal,8,disagree

558450411510431744,r/teenagers,serious-personal,66,if you don't know what you want to do you should have the *option*
558450421492875268,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,hence optional
558450479252635649,r/teenagers,serious-personal,56,it shouldn't be mandatory but the choice should be there
558450799206989855,r/teenagers,serious-personal,53,swo then they should be allowed to take those classes
558450870854090752,r/teenagers,serious-personal,60,you should have an apprentice understanding of most subjects
558450935777460255,r/teenagers,serious-personal,82,but why would you attain a college level understanding of a subject you don't need
558450953972350976,r/teenagers,serious-personal,20,it serves no purpose
558451047375568921,r/teenagers,serious-personal,14,thats not true
