558452689508237335,150,Wait seriously? 125 free md? Plus the possibly 100-125 we get from new event...hey I might not have to whale eyepatch Alice if I get her on step 2 lol
558789589800583182,42,Welp...I’m off to farm this dumb event lol
558789711901098011,21,Barrier hella helpful
558795081235038218,26,Eh...they might repeat FCE
558795106002534470,30,That’s what they’ve been doing
558796178460770333,38,I know. I want memory fragments too...
558796246748364832,36,I’m...6 fragments from Argo r5 armor
558798681000640546,85,This eldrie and eugeo event better give at least 6 more missions for memory fragments
558799344510173214,75,Hm...I need to make space in inventory...do I sell old armors or old acc???
558799466963009536,4,Okay
558799544138072112,7,True...
558799585439645696,31,And armor is easily replaceable
558800628730560543,12,No you can’t
558801759116460053,46,Wait what? What do you mean? How do I do this?
558801841060577307,25,Yeah that’s not happening
558801892491264010,35,I’m not getting rid of an r5 weapon
558801974141779990,19,I have 34 right now
558802257357832193,76,Is it worth building 1 of this event acc and armor or are they pretty trash?
558802495913066508,38,I’m not wasting my md for shitty equip
558802646354493447,48,I’m investing my md into a future r5 dual blades
558802917881282560,80,Well right now_ I’m being hella stingy with md cuz I’m saving for r5 dual blades
558802973723983883,9,Thank you
558803148882313217,30,220 is what my inventory is at
558803252502593537,10,Uh...what?
558803370316398601,52,Oh...yeah bro they may never reintroduce that banner
558803403661115424,21,Maybe a year from now
558803515405762617,41,Glaring light isn’t in the pool for those
558803616769769472,21,I’d say hang on to em
558803693064028172,46,And hope they eventually rerelease that banner
558803976682864640,53,3 more yuna swords and I could have r5ed it...ah well
558804070169706518,51,And I don’t mean the free non elem one—the fire one
558804149995569152,7,Seven 🤮
558804469270315008,111,After I get r5 dual blades I might pick back up competitively playing again...but then i wanna go for r5 rapier
558804704784547850,49,Maybe...I dunno...I guess it’ll depend on my luck
558805152438681613,188,I can’t quite remember how much md it cost me to get r5 loli Alice rodNLNLI believe it took me...(and I got lucky this banner) 950 (step 5) + 750 md to get Christmas sniper and auto rifle r5
558805489295556608,101,That’s why I’m saving (May still spend to get myself to get closer to spending for my r5 dual blades)
558805517556776970,6,Rain 🤮
558805664797818915,10,Uh...what?
558805770792075264,46,Bro I’m hella gay for asuna_ sinon and Pitohui
558805888064946198,21,Pito high key sexy af
558805965894320128,11,She’s legal
558806010169655315,20,She just LOOKS young
558806129082105867,18,Alice irl no exist
558806537766961162,21,Don’t spoil LN please
558806643312164884,54,If it hasn’t happened in the anime yet_ don’t spoil it
558806744055152661,2,No
558806931880280099,111,The only spoiler MD gives is the fact eugeo becomes an integrity knight...and its for like...10 minutes if that
558807546731954188,136,Tbh for all the hype_ integrity knight eugeo was kinda let down...only like 10 minutes of that armor then he went back to the other coat
558810256340156420,61,Argh_ drop more earth medallions you stupid headless bastard!
558810384148987918,18,I only need 5 more
558810398187323405,3,Atm
558810416143138817,18,For eyepatch Alice
558811969948352513,67,Quick question...is yuna or asuna the better of the fire os banner?
558812929240334367,82,I mean like...which one would be more worth limit breaking for future fire ranking
558813098295951381,131,I mean...if they’re pretty equal in terms of dmg and dps...I have r5 fire sword yuna can use (or Tengu yuuki) so...there IS that...
558813299483869193,38,Pls take that to <#314775261826777098>
558813456942497792,55,So...dmg and dps wise asuna and yuna were pretty equal?
558813851399880706,138,Fair enough...my asuna is already 95 so I was just wondering if I should finish her then go to yuna or just leave her at 95 and go to yuna
558814026696622084,37,True 🤔 I do really like both mlb arts
558814252698173445,112,I like yuna mlb art more than non mlb art...even though it kinda reminds me of her art for the SAO OS soundtrack
558814667678679051,134,But as far as dark hc go...maybe even rainbow too...I am getting swordcraft yuuk to 100 because her mlb art wayyyy better than non mlb
558815170495774735,41,Her mlb art looks better than non mlb art
558815209574105101,27,Non mlb art looks weird tbh
558817176732303400,158,I’m second_ kicked by a guy with the exact same team as that first place of yours lol...oh wait! He swapped out sinon for Halloween asuna...clever bastard lol
558817320601124866,41,My first place is at 15 sec_ me at 17 sec
558817986488696832,29,Hold on...yuuki can 13 sec? 😳
558818032583966752,18,At lvl 90 with r5?
558818108924624898,14,Oh she’s lead?
558818175207079938,37,I have Halloween asuna for lead skill
558818450307547136,50,Then again...I don’t think I’m gonna beat this lol
558818578850119691,32,I doubt I’m beating this guy lol
558818690527789058,79,He can have first place...I’ll just sit here hope 17 sec will keep me in second
558819936672284682,27,He has 15 sec I have 17 sec
558820103987265539,25,I whaled yesterday...hard
558820230135152640,0,
558820254118313995,4,$150
558820440064131094,84,Yuuki and an asuna dupeNLLots of regular hcNLStep 3 (2 and 3 in the whaling) for Alice
558820470086959124,20,And then that silica
558820565490597888,48,Yuuki and Alice were my target. Silica was bonus
558820821108391947,122,Her idle animation? Yeah she’s fucking adorable. I’m gonna invest dark and rainbow hc into mlb her because I love that art
558821278757289995,59,Yes!!! Only need 4 more earth medallions for eyepatch alive
558822221808926726,65,Ugh stupid headless dude keeps dropping fire medallions not earth
558829998136623126,184,I just realized something...I think trophy next month is either lance or rapier—there’s 2 ss3 on lance and rapier...but only 1 idle animationNLNLMe thinks...Quinella trophy next month? 😐
558830321131585546,67,Would kinda make some sense since bitch never really leaves the bed
558830998180331530,33,Idk_ just thinking out loud sorta
558831639019651082,10,Hey Yunaeo

558832266307043348,18,I whaled yesterday
558832385781792801,5,Yup ^
558832647485259798,121,Thank you 😊...$150 worth tbh cuz it I also got dupe asuna (which is why yuuki is lvl 90) and a bunch of 4 and 5* dupes so
558832700220243969,41,Yeah <@283790768252911619> ya told me lol
558832918349348864,134,And Alice only required step 3 so that’s 500 potential md I can save for oh I don’t know_ toward the r5 dual blades I plan to save for
558833274240106507,11,In ranking?
558833491823951892,126,Hm...you said you got swordcraft asuna and yuuki...I would use both of them and hina asuna cuz she boosts atk of combo partner
558833632702234626,26,That’s my opinion at least
558833792572194820,43,The loli one with bow <@390270783869681665>
558833889976778764,15,Oh does it? 😳 ^
558833969810898945,17,Huh...interesting
558834053512691723,32,Does that apply to TF units too?
558834171091353620,33,Wait...so...parries cancel buffs?
558834309788860426,19,Not quite following
558834558896963584,88,<@157532893160144896> I don’t quite understand what you were saying about the buffs loss
558834665415507984,18,Oh! The lightning!
558834962628083712,6,Gotcha
558838519037165587,13,Hella helpful
558841867547049984,58,If you even get to third parry <:Kappa:315824076012912642>
558844783389442071,1,🤔
558844867376185345,44,You mean from 5th to 7th? Or did you improve
558845180086583297,23,Oh...sorry I misread it
558845392658235402,39,Looks like Monday night/Tuesday morning
558845585038508032,32,Rain banner just came out. Chill
558850890145202178,64,I like 2 unit banners_ easier to get r5s and hc for limit breaks
558859137547763713,43,You’ve got no md to try getting another 6*?
558859331299442698,17,You a new player?
558859409565024267,32,Then you can farm WAYYYY more md
558859533632667648,36,There’s GGO and event quests and FCE
558859573981609984,14,Floor clearing
558860525446889473,424,Hm...you’re a new player so...honestly all the current 6* banners aren’t badNLNLAsuna and yuuki healNLRain ~~trash~~ and sinon give crit dmg boostNLFanatio and bercouli are mitigation so they can keep combo earlier NLEyepatch Alice heals and has a good combo hit count...but there are a bunch of 6* in that banner...NLNLTbh I suggest doing at least the discount of all of em since you’re new...probably eyepatch Alice banner first.
558861129242378240,24,<@352046413103759360> hi
558861311786745866,72,Eyepatch Alice banner has a bunch of other 6* too...yeah I’d do that one
558861398776610827,50,Eh I’m just farming this bs headless bastard event
558861572425121794,69,I can farm master but only because I have mlb units_ 2 with r5 weapon
558861787223818259,33,Wait...seriously? EX gives 500? 😐
558861926470385683,68,Master only gives 700...what the actual fuck am I farming master for
558861991712915476,31,I aim scouting sinon or rain...
558862146994438154,34,Alice is more baka. Baka baka baka
558862236924248065,50,I’m sorry...I just love that seen in Alicization 😆
558862722914189325,57,Welp...imma go back to farming now that I’ve eaten dinner
558863587763027997,26,Get your own damn food lol
558866472416575508,38,Yay! Eyepatch Alice skill slots done 😊
558867955346046979,35,I wouldn’t expect to stay in rank 2
558868214763749376,41,Ugh...20k EP down...20k to go...kill me 😩
558868291318448148,12,Dead bracket
558868321056063489,5,Lucky
558868564472496152,28,You’d be top 5 in my bracket
558869300455276548,39,Sorry but that’s not a guaranteed top 5
558870724450844683,97,<@!151427882038722560> current state of your bracket doesn’t mean people won’t try to snipe top 5
558872320576323595,40,🤔 maybe in the new story unlock missions
558872605025763349,75,You can get 1 from a master +1 mission (but master +1 isn’t open right now)
