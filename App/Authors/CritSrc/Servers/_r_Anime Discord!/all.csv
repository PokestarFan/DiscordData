558763249131061259,anime,38,Tamamo was what got me into Waifuverse
558763605722660874,anime,23,CCC is amusing to watch

558763959105093670,anime,4,hmmm

558764010623860746,anime,31,<:hyperawoo:358633552562225152>
558764525265092619,anime,27,Mob is absolutely brilliant
558764726088105987,anime,74,it's probably the best portrayal of teen angst and proper ethos we have rn
558770015352913925,anime,86,<@177127764355317760> Try reading 19th Century books instead <:LUL:529569462752641034>

559021191764115456,anime,15,pretentious git
559021503111364619,anime,176,I'd much prefer Psycho-Pass Makishima ||to just admit that he likes killing_ BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD and just have that as a motive behind his scheming rather than high ideas||
559021665565278208,anime,71,S2's villian just a has a grievance and acts it out with no pretentions

559022222019395594,anime,141,it's a neat cop show_ don't get me wrong_ I gripe with how it presents itself as a holisitic setting_ when it never shows how and why that is
559022546545278997,anime,152,which is where Shinsekai Yori comes in_ makes everyone flat as the field and has the setting and situation speak for itself <:ginsan:529569462886858772>
