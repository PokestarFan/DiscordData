559073944897060874,general,43,Honestly my niece is so fucking cute though

559077774195949594,general,51,My fucking niece in elementary school has two weeks
559077840507633678,general,67,Like bitch college students need more of a break than first graders

559078037392719892,general,48,I think she‚Äôs kinda behind on the learning curve
559078099090931722,general,67,Like I was thinking for a while that she might have slight dyslexia
559078165843148820,general,37,And the poor kid has such bad anxiety
559078229458288662,general,32,My niece has two weeks not three
559078366343462942,general,33,I‚Äôm so fucking excited for summer
559078436170235924,general,83,Last summer I took two classes so I‚Äôve been nonstop doing school since fall of 2017
559078488817139735,general,54,Almost two years straight of stressful college courses
559078509423886386,general,25,A full load each semester
559078613224521740,general,144,And I‚Äôm taking an extra class this semester cause there was a typo on the requirements for AA sheet so I had to do one more class than I thought
559078697991143424,general,41,My transcripts are fucking AMAZING though
559078714491797505,general,12,I have a 4.0
559078820955553795,general,37,After taking uhhhh 19 college courses

559088384472121354,general,75,Just some vaccines need a booster here and there in case the strain changes
559088523819614220,general,132,Legitimately all vaccines do is introduce a dead form of the virus so your body can fight it momentarily so they have the antibodies
559088539157921812,general,24,This isn‚Äôt a debate hobo
559088622981349396,general,98,<@548124499162169357> and tbh any harm it could cause would be less than dying of a deadly disease
559088851952336896,general,139,I laugh at the fact so many people are anti vaccine cause of the autism thing like you‚Äôd rather have a kid possibly die than have autism???
559088951357603860,general,106,<@548124499162169357> no it has preservatives to make it so the vaccine is good for longer inside the vile
559089029723717651,general,86,Which btw vaccines don‚Äôt even have thimerosal in them anymore cause of the huge uproar
559089084568567812,general,49,When thimerosal wasn‚Äôt even harmful to begin with
559089235421036587,general,121,Also people are freaked out about the formaldehyde but we have more natural formaldehyde in our bodies than a vaccine has
559089282346647573,general,77,Everything in a vaccine that preserves it_ we have more in our bodies already
559089466053099521,general,147,<@548124499162169357> I heard in that doc they‚Äôd have something prove them wrong and be like ‚Äúyeah it‚Äôs interesting huh?‚Äù And not say anything else
559089555416940550,general,41,I want to watch that documentary actually
559089819301707791,general,269,But so yeah <@548124499162169357> to finalize_ everything in a vaccine is in such small amounts that it wouldn‚Äôt be able to harm us because we already have those things in us in larger quantities and whatever extra we get from the vaccine our body is able to filter out
559090041008422927,general,36,It‚Äôs legitimately not harmful to you
559090121652043818,general,105,You might get a fever at first cause your body is like ‚Äúintruder alert‚Äù but it won‚Äôt usually go past that
559090174831755284,general,68,Make sure though that you‚Äôre not allergic to any vaccine ingredients
559090187607605284,general,21,Cause that can happen
559090506810785815,general,43,Vaping is just nicotine infused water vapor
559090538683301909,general,42,Not as harmful as smoking legitimate smoke
559090586586710016,general,78,But still bad for your lungs because you‚Äôre not supposed to breathe in liquids
559090649199149057,general,42,I couldn‚Äôt figure out the right words sera
559090685614096499,general,34,It‚Äôs better than burning something
559090703381037059,general,22,And inhaling the smoke
559090734406303755,general,19,Not just cigarettes
559090741629026304,general,8,Weed too
559090777289129986,general,34,Any inhalation is smoke is harmful
559090849430896661,general,45,Obviously if you do it once there‚Äôs no damage
559090891428462602,general,53,But if you do it religiously you‚Äôll damage your lungs
559094155041570838,general,42,Also some people have home tattoo machines
559094237640261654,general,61,Oh god guac I heard they‚Äôre super sore for a few months after
559094285870301207,general,82,Wouldn‚Äôt that suck with being in the military? Do you have to do drills and stuff?
559094307869556756,general,33,Also wearing bras is a no I heard
559096687998795776,general,10,I LOVE YOU
559096762607075328,general,86,It works out that John doesn‚Äôt like pickles but I do cause I can just have his pickles

559096872090992640,general,40,But I‚Äôm leaning more towards 9 grain now
559096896514162706,general,28,9 grain just has more flavor
559096947831734273,general,36,Naw I like my subway sandwiches cold
559097076173242408,general,16,Mmmm provolone ü§§
