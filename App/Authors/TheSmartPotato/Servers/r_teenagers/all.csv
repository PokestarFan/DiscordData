559077736602402846,general,31,My spring break was only 1 week
559077774195949594,general,51,My fucking niece in elementary school has two weeks
559077840507633678,general,67,Like bitch college students need more of a break than first graders
559077996997378078,general,28,My niece does work very hard
559078037392719892,general,48,I think she’s kinda behind on the learning curve
559078099090931722,general,67,Like I was thinking for a while that she might have slight dyslexia
559078165843148820,general,37,And the poor kid has such bad anxiety
559078229458288662,general,32,My niece has two weeks not three
559078366343462942,general,33,I’m so fucking excited for summer
559078436170235924,general,83,Last summer I took two classes so I’ve been nonstop doing school since fall of 2017
559078488817139735,general,54,Almost two years straight of stressful college courses
559078509423886386,general,25,A full load each semester
559078613224521740,general,144,And I’m taking an extra class this semester cause there was a typo on the requirements for AA sheet so I had to do one more class than I thought
559078697991143424,general,41,My transcripts are fucking AMAZING though
559078714491797505,general,12,I have a 4.0
559078820955553795,general,37,After taking uhhhh 19 college courses

559088384472121354,general,75,Just some vaccines need a booster here and there in case the strain changes
559088523819614220,general,132,Legitimately all vaccines do is introduce a dead form of the virus so your body can fight it momentarily so they have the antibodies
559088539157921812,general,24,This isn’t a debate hobo
559088622981349396,general,98,<@548124499162169357> and tbh any harm it could cause would be less than dying of a deadly disease
559088851952336896,general,139,I laugh at the fact so many people are anti vaccine cause of the autism thing like you’d rather have a kid possibly die than have autism???
559088951357603860,general,106,<@548124499162169357> no it has preservatives to make it so the vaccine is good for longer inside the vile
559089029723717651,general,86,Which btw vaccines don’t even have thimerosal in them anymore cause of the huge uproar
559089084568567812,general,49,When thimerosal wasn’t even harmful to begin with
559089235421036587,general,121,Also people are freaked out about the formaldehyde but we have more natural formaldehyde in our bodies than a vaccine has
559089282346647573,general,77,Everything in a vaccine that preserves it_ we have more in our bodies already
559089466053099521,general,147,<@548124499162169357> I heard in that doc they’d have something prove them wrong and be like “yeah it’s interesting huh?” And not say anything else
559089555416940550,general,41,I want to watch that documentary actually
559089819301707791,general,269,But so yeah <@548124499162169357> to finalize_ everything in a vaccine is in such small amounts that it wouldn’t be able to harm us because we already have those things in us in larger quantities and whatever extra we get from the vaccine our body is able to filter out
559090041008422927,general,36,It’s legitimately not harmful to you
