559078099090931722,r/teenagers,general,67,Like I was thinking for a while that she might have slight dyslexia
559078165843148820,r/teenagers,general,37,And the poor kid has such bad anxiety
559078229458288662,r/teenagers,general,32,My niece has two weeks not three

559078436170235924,r/teenagers,general,83,Last summer I took two classes so I’ve been nonstop doing school since fall of 2017
559078488817139735,r/teenagers,general,54,Almost two years straight of stressful college courses
559078509423886386,r/teenagers,general,25,A full load each semester
559078613224521740,r/teenagers,general,144,And I’m taking an extra class this semester cause there was a typo on the requirements for AA sheet so I had to do one more class than I thought

559078714491797505,r/teenagers,general,12,I have a 4.0

559088384472121354,r/teenagers,general,75,Just some vaccines need a booster here and there in case the strain changes
559088523819614220,r/teenagers,general,132,Legitimately all vaccines do is introduce a dead form of the virus so your body can fight it momentarily so they have the antibodies
559088539157921812,r/teenagers,general,24,This isn’t a debate hobo
559088622981349396,r/teenagers,general,98,<@548124499162169357> and tbh any harm it could cause would be less than dying of a deadly disease
559088851952336896,r/teenagers,general,139,I laugh at the fact so many people are anti vaccine cause of the autism thing like you’d rather have a kid possibly die than have autism???
559088951357603860,r/teenagers,general,106,<@548124499162169357> no it has preservatives to make it so the vaccine is good for longer inside the vile
559089029723717651,r/teenagers,general,86,Which btw vaccines don’t even have thimerosal in them anymore cause of the huge uproar
