560624273224630282,general,62,even if a non-PE goal were raised_ i don't think you'd lose it
560624376471355429,general,88,because PE are the only thing that is counted by inspecting contract completion... afaik
560624573645848576,general,16,cheating is fine
560624590036926538,general,18,just not in a coop
560624609196507137,general,41,unless the coop has explicitly allowed it
560624786837864469,general,43,oh_ referring to lamCube's comment. no idea
560625290888347679,general,10,haha_ nice
560625341312401420,general,33,i could probably help them fix it
560625349952667672,general,17,but i'm not gonna
560625452285296705,general,76,i only use my 1337 h4x0r skillz for good... and neutral... and slightly evil
560625591062102041,general,89,based on my understanding of the game i'm not entirely sure why that would happen_ though
560625614726627358,general,7,ah well
560625674877009930,general,72,i mean_ it seems to me like they'd be able to restart the contract again
560625713250828292,general,61,if it got saved incorrectly in such a way that the PE is lost
560625763766763520,general,6,Indeed
