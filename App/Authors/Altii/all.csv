558107083749326848,r/teengamingnights,general,147,the general channel in teenserv is one of the worst. Everything is moving by at the speed of light_ half the people there are meming or starbaiting
558107308878463026,r/teengamingnights,general,107,It's when people post things for the sole purpose of getting someone to add the ‚≠ê reaction to their message
558107405930594317,r/teengamingnights,general,106,because there's a starboard channel and if you get 9 people to react with ‚≠ê your message gets posted there
558107427736780811,r/teengamingnights,general,10,it's awful
558107448905302027,r/teengamingnights,general,20,all of it is garbage
558107659044257802,r/teengamingnights,general,45,The entire concept of stars I think is stupid
558107742246666244,r/teengamingnights,general,112,There's already an entire subreddit where you can post shitty memes and low-effort content_ why spam it here too
558460098239004703,r/teengamingnights,general,111,If you guys have this many issues with a single guy_ maybe you should actually have someone ask a mod about it?
558460145625989120,r/teengamingnights,general,47,instead of just complaining amongst each other?

558465862059950090,r/teenagers,server-feedback,96,Can we get the user limits on the quiet channels lowered back to 4_5_6? Or maybe do 4_6_8 intead
558465953650835458,r/teenagers,server-feedback,30,I'd even be fine with a 2 or 3
