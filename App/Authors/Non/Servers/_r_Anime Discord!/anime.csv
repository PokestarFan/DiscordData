559096961517486081,87,On a side note Inuyasha is another good isekai if you're into early 2000s looking anime

559097351596277760,23,Alice in the wonderland
559097676759826443,72,How about FLATLAND by Edwin Abbott Abbott? It counts as a reverse-isekai
559097941931982868,6,Nope ‚ùé
559098057036398622,81,Jk who cares about manliness when you can watch Kirito make his harem even bigger

559099148843089932,8,BIG HYPE
559099229646094382,26,Yu-No remake is coming tho
559099332586897428,49,That's almost halfway as good as Tsukihime remake
559099355848638484,10,I think so
559099538728812550,35,The manga is great_ but play the VN
559099692621889558,59,Far side is probably the best VN experience I've had so far
559100128552681494,55,SAO season 1's first half is where is should have ended
559100264263712799,24,Any Sakurasou fans here?
559100647560183809,39,BGS was good (same author as Sakurasou)
559100659006177289,4,Yeah
559100861826072604,43,Sakurasou is moe about the after effect tho

559101217071169546,35,I hate the imouto in Sakurasouu btw
559101236390133771,12,Chinami iirc
559101786594738176,37,Oh shit is it really that disgusting?
559101966098366469,131,It's pretty normal to romanticize mental illnesses nowadays_ so I don't really see a problem in fetishizing it if I think I like it
559102191659646997,29,Just Because has a slow start
559103429935497234,57,The symmetry in that shot is nice but it feels unsettling
