558847343982804993,164,I'm trying to build a nether wart farm_ but as I start the collection system_ this happens .... is there no way to avoid having to turn this farm around 90 degrees?
558848859124531230,82,I don't think there's any way around having to change the orientation of the farm?
558849335933009940,126,<@211625072190947331> any suggestions how to overcome rail defaults? The adjacent powered rails are proving extremely stubborn

558866089182756894,131,Not sure why I'm wasting all my dirt when I could be wasting cobble_ but I'm too lazy to get the cobble out of that shulker.... lol
