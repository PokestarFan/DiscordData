560977253522079746,Axis Order,general_gaming,68,I'll show off the mastercicle as soon as i'm able to turn it back on
560983630240022538,Axis Order,general_gaming,146,<@207625855697027083> the mastercycle is immune to fall damage and goes slightly faster than royal white stallion_ but takes more time to speed up
560983672753487912,Axis Order,general_gaming,29,So not really a plastic horse
560983772678455297,Axis Order,general_gaming,23,More like a speed demon
560984311344398338,Axis Order,general_gaming,0,

560984531696484393,Axis Order,general,12,Morning case
560984559131295744,Axis Order,general,20,Any drawings for us?
560984976682909727,Axis Order,general_gaming,47,Well_ I apperently unequipped my ancient saddle
560985016834850857,Axis Order,general_gaming,26,But thats another dl√ß item
560985082337165312,Axis Order,general_gaming,47,It allows your horsie to be summonable anywhere
560985972020609025,Axis Order,general_gaming,15,Horses are cool
560986026995220481,Axis Order,general_gaming,37,After you properly learn the controls
560986067889684546,Axis Order,general_gaming,28,Or for just going on strolls
560986120150843394,Axis Order,general_gaming,48,The master cycle controls are very different tho
560986234378518578,Axis Order,general_gaming,35,Its big problem is... it needs fuel
560986274454831116,Axis Order,general_gaming,31,But it can be summoned anywhere
560986312639774740,Axis Order,general_gaming,32,And anything can be used as fuel
560986330939654162,Axis Order,general_gaming,16,So its no biggie
560986429275242506,Axis Order,general_gaming,36,Its a use for monster parts at least
560986487911481366,Axis Order,general_gaming,46,Since elixirs kinda suck when compared to food
