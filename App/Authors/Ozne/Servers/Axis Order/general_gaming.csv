560975464923922463,12,Look at this
560977049297223690,29,My switch ran outta batteries
560977070218280960,4,Lmao
560977101721698356,16,Its charging now
560977253522079746,68,I'll show off the mastercicle as soon as i'm able to turn it back on
560983630240022538,146,<@207625855697027083> the mastercycle is immune to fall damage and goes slightly faster than royal white stallion_ but takes more time to speed up
560983672753487912,29,So not really a plastic horse
560983772678455297,23,More like a speed demon
560984311344398338,0,
560984367837478923,28,Here it is_ the mastercycle!
560984976682909727,47,Well_ I apperently unequipped my ancient saddle
560985016834850857,26,But thats another dl√ß item
560985082337165312,47,It allows your horsie to be summonable anywhere
560985972020609025,15,Horses are cool
560986026995220481,37,After you properly learn the controls
560986067889684546,28,Or for just going on strolls
560986120150843394,48,The master cycle controls are very different tho
560986234378518578,35,Its big problem is... it needs fuel
560986274454831116,31,But it can be summoned anywhere
560986312639774740,32,And anything can be used as fuel
560986330939654162,16,So its no biggie
560986429275242506,36,Its a use for monster parts at least
560986487911481366,46,Since elixirs kinda suck when compared to food
560986629897191424,38,And the refueling animation is awesome
560986682975977492,38,Thats one thing I love about this game
560986712587894795,18,Everything is just
560986730816208906,8,Gorgeous
