560975464923922463,general_gaming,12,Look at this
560976015376121891,general,27,Then she'll die even faster
560976037366988800,general,28,<:lemons:322459208731721738>
560977049297223690,general_gaming,29,My switch ran outta batteries
560977070218280960,general_gaming,4,Lmao
560977101721698356,general_gaming,16,Its charging now
560977253522079746,general_gaming,68,I'll show off the mastercicle as soon as i'm able to turn it back on
560983630240022538,general_gaming,146,<@207625855697027083> the mastercycle is immune to fall damage and goes slightly faster than royal white stallion_ but takes more time to speed up
560983672753487912,general_gaming,29,So not really a plastic horse
560983772678455297,general_gaming,23,More like a speed demon
560984311344398338,general_gaming,0,
560984367837478923,general_gaming,28,Here it is_ the mastercycle!
560984531696484393,general,12,Morning case
560984559131295744,general,20,Any drawings for us?
560984976682909727,general_gaming,47,Well_ I apperently unequipped my ancient saddle
560985016834850857,general_gaming,26,But thats another dl√ß item
560985082337165312,general_gaming,47,It allows your horsie to be summonable anywhere
560985972020609025,general_gaming,15,Horses are cool
560986026995220481,general_gaming,37,After you properly learn the controls
560986067889684546,general_gaming,28,Or for just going on strolls
560986120150843394,general_gaming,48,The master cycle controls are very different tho
560986234378518578,general_gaming,35,Its big problem is... it needs fuel
560986274454831116,general_gaming,31,But it can be summoned anywhere
560986312639774740,general_gaming,32,And anything can be used as fuel
560986330939654162,general_gaming,16,So its no biggie
560986429275242506,general_gaming,36,Its a use for monster parts at least
560986487911481366,general_gaming,46,Since elixirs kinda suck when compared to food
560986629897191424,general_gaming,38,And the refueling animation is awesome
560986682975977492,general_gaming,38,Thats one thing I love about this game
560986712587894795,general_gaming,18,Everything is just
560986730816208906,general_gaming,8,Gorgeous
560986768128868373,general_gaming,39,<@135205901152944128> the seat opens up
560986807718772738,general_gaming,25,And you throw stuff in it
560986864924753920,general_gaming,41,And then theres a neat blue energy effect
560987981901463572,general_gaming,28,Horses are terrible for that
