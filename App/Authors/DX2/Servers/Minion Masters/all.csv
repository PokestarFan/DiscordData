560631690125639687,minion_masters_general,35,he just sits on the opponents tower
560631732429258773,minion_masters_general,25,and do absolutely nothing
560631794270076958,minion_masters_general,10,poor scrat

560641181168697344,minion_masters_general,32,just because it has a glitch uwu
560641313775550499,minion_masters_general,46,you need to be really fast to bhole combustion
560641432038277141,minion_masters_general,37,considering you literally have 400 ms
560641912491737098,minion_masters_general,56,I usually use it when there is a lot of minions together
560643236688035850,minion_masters_general,45,Or you use scripts<:Puffa:500302539468832788>
560949138552782850,minion_masters_general,19,combustion guardian
560949337790873641,minion_masters_general,46,don't make guardian the next demon warrior plz

560955560216756224,minion_masters_general,32,Reboomer makes boomer irrelevant
561003065696583681,minion_masters_general,70,<@230902648490950656> you forgot harbinger when he had an insane range
561003394798583811,minion_masters_general,75,But yeah I think devs should be more careful with what they add to the game
561003561081634816,minion_masters_general,61,Im really afraid with what is comming in the next battle pass
561003724403900426,minion_masters_general,41,I hope it will not be infinite stun decks
561003822281916417,minion_masters_general,25,<:Cry:311053991142227968>
561004570852065300,minion_masters_general,39,Shieldguard on the other hand is a hell
561004679081754649,minion_masters_general,69,You can't play any smal minion to counter it until hia shield is down
561004933550178362,minion_masters_general,39,Brothers of light is so easy to counter
