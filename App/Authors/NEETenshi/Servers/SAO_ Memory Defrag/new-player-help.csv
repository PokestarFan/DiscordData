558431909911461897,48,Does saomd have google play missions? First news
558432047509536768,91,I play on android and all google takes part in is stealing my money and converting it to md
558433378278572043,78,I believe there is a form you can fill and send to scamco to get your acc back
558433425241931816,51,Go to the saomd support page and it should be there
558992556281692162,40,Those missiosn are for a different quest
558992634493009960,66,"Friendly Match in Fairyland" is the quest that came out yesterday
558992768119078942,76,Also the timing for Eldrie/Eugeo is on the notice_ they rotate every 3 hours
558993055319982080,47,To be fair even those are the same for everyone
558993092359880704,59,You just get them earlier or later depending on your logins
558996184492933129,36,At the end of November_ bath ranking
559001591189995552,36,don't worry about R5 armors early on
559001621246246913,55,just slowly farm MFs whenever possible until you get 50
559001703807189003,75,tier lists are worthless in this game so just ignore <@!262780141485293569>
559001713793826827,25,<:mmV:295974268913582080>
559001829216616449,22,swords are very common
559002005516058639,39,well ye at this point you might as well
559002027456462848,17,but in the future
559002232570511370,27,those weapons are very good
559002262274310144,44,Kirito's sword is the best dark sword so far
559002422643785758,45,best armor for swordcraft yuuki is yuuki's R5
559002510229110794,33,it's all there on the site I sent
559002613153005589,0,
559002673245061133,36,yeah the ranking armors are all good
559002699685691392,14,3% dmg on crit
559002740903247882,84,though depending on your run the older 3% damage on weakpoint armors might be better
559002833287118881,121,<@305454993157128194> don't assume anything_ we had the first ever wind ranking since 6* came out in September last month
559002888093827083,62,we've had repeat element rankings before wind ever came around
559002923749605396,12,in September
559002928048766977,3,lul
559002959791521802,23,I said it in my message
559003086539063308,46,also the previous wind ranking was last summer
559003091803045891,4,lulz
559003139441819649,19,that was 5* era tho
559003216952426498,94,<@340138975924715520> all R5 armors have a base ATK value and then 3/2% buff for certain units
559003289270878208,106,Argo's armor is usually recommended as first armor because it has the highest base attack and it is unisex
559003346317475850,56,the rest of the armors are locked to their units' gender
559003436386091040,80,<@305454993157128194> we might get a rainbow banner with a water unit (or units)
559003564387598366,3,yes
559003593047408640,45,that's always been the case since 6* came out
559003609971556372,29,only exception was SKS banner
559003649045430272,9,Sankishin
559003670679912449,36,the goddess banner we got in January
559003758743257088,62,Also keep in mind only 200 HC of another element can be traded
559003818080206859,74,no_ the most recent rainbow banner is the currently-ongoing Rain/Sinon one
559003833263456276,32,and we can trade HCs on that one
559003882123165697,99,I think they didn't let us trade on SKS since 2/3 elements were repeats from January's first banner
559003948489506828,53,the % attack bonus is not as important as base attack
559004014071644165,24,just do some quick maffs
559004062906056724,26,3% of 8k attack is 240 atk
559004105323053067,36,base attack on most armors is 400ish
559004222855708692,48,also base attack gets attack buffs applied to it
559004269907279873,65,whereas the atk boost is only additively added to the other buffs
559004333056983080,30,basically base stats > % buffs
559004406880927765,71,if you can get a unit to match like Yuuki with Yuuki armor_ then better
559004421632163841,28,but it's not super important
559004489114189849,30,yeah that table is pinned here
559004511373361153,34,in case you want to check it later
559004555656953856,55,~~though I kind of disagree with some of the rankings~~
559004611948707850,6,Is it?
559004620316475394,15,did you update?
559004689618829313,24,oh you added Eugeo armor
559004694735880212,11,I see I see
559004721986273281,42,maybe we should pin the google doc instead
559004751522562058,19,oh but it is pinned
559004801510146048,36,Insane Armor is locked to male units
559004814374338563,20,Argo armor is unisex
559004823299555348,21,this is a huge factor
559004866823979008,3,kek
