560623596855230475,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,98,I want pewdiepie to reach 100M first but I want tseries to end pewdiepies 5 year long streak first
560624082568085514,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,226,Both channels have been too close to each other for too long. At their growth rate_ Tseries should have passed pewdiepie long ago_ but cos of ppl like mrbeast_ Jack etc it didn't happen. So it must happen. The streak must end.
