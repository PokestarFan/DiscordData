558464678473498644,139,<@503906085015388160> the staff manually reviews every request to reset any account info. You need to wait for 3 to 7 working days normally
558464847503818764,39,uninstall urself from this world yeeeet
558465156397662228,76,<@420317826340093952> dont be so toxic bro uninstall urself from the werrrld
558465392952082432,205,<@333606016413466624> if it was skilled based match making the higher tier pubs would all be like scrips and turtle wars. People would get burnt out faster_ so fortnite isnt making the same mistake as csgo
558465605687050240,214,<@333606016413466624> this game has a perfect food chain. the sweats rek the bots the same way the big fish eat the little fish. You may feel bad about dying a lot but you are playing a vital role in the food chain
558465854094966790,208,<@333606016413466624> yeah well i didnt say they died_ they will never die. No game with flagship mechanics and strategy_ will die easily. Dota and lol are still going strong_ even WoW and those are old as fk
558466028338806786,202,<@396390935656923156> well thats good_ why not take everyones ideas into account lol. Hope you're not one of those anal kids who thinks there should be 1 guy brainstorming everything or else its cOpYing
558466355993772033,296,<@333606016413466624> this genre hasnt been around. If you mean BR then idk_ but fortnite isnt just br. The main thing is building_ and its always changing. Theres always new styles that people pick up watching streamers and competitives. You just get good at that and you'll see immediate change
558467281433133074,371,<@333606016413466624> dualies are better than pumps in some scenarios. at least the damage is consistent. but i get what u mean_ its unfair a lot but if building just comes naturally you can outplay the opponent with nothing but a pistol or even pickaxe. Trust me I've seen it done_ some of my friends are insane players with 10kd+ who do that stuff to impress each other
558470321833771052,97,<@!256732467250069504> nah just do it_ if something goes wrong u can sue fortnite for many vbucks
558471537586470954,99,you may never be acctually good cus most people arent_ since playstyles keep evolving and changing.
558471688753250304,130,but you can easily look good cus turbo building is so advanced now. Practically every bot knows how to spam a fort when under fire
559006888449277982,41,<@558142921434464256> u mean the discord?
559007084188925955,102,no heâ€™s permanent banned_ tell him no and to go away. Make friends with law abiding citizens next time
