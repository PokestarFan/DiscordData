558465392952082432,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,205,<@333606016413466624> if it was skilled based match making the higher tier pubs would all be like scrips and turtle wars. People would get burnt out faster_ so fortnite isnt making the same mistake as csgo
558465605687050240,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,214,<@333606016413466624> this game has a perfect food chain. the sweats rek the bots the same way the big fish eat the little fish. You may feel bad about dying a lot but you are playing a vital role in the food chain
558465854094966790,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,208,<@333606016413466624> yeah well i didnt say they died_ they will never die. No game with flagship mechanics and strategy_ will die easily. Dota and lol are still going strong_ even WoW and those are old as fk

558467281433133074,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,371,<@333606016413466624> dualies are better than pumps in some scenarios. at least the damage is consistent. but i get what u mean_ its unfair a lot but if building just comes naturally you can outplay the opponent with nothing but a pistol or even pickaxe. Trust me I've seen it done_ some of my friends are insane players with 10kd+ who do that stuff to impress each other
