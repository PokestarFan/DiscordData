558788621034061844,MINECRAFT,minecraft,53,<@!519658375391346698> How about you stop mini-moding
558788713120006145,MINECRAFT,minecraft,29,Its annoying and un-nessesary
558790387075121152,MINECRAFT,minecraft,503,Mini-moding is annoying and he keeps telling us to do everything we do is wrong.NLNLAnd I agree to that statement <@!530361907283099650> however Mini-moding excessively can be annoying_ and yeah_ a kind reminder to keep it in a channel is good but he's been doing it for the past 10 minutes. And also I agree that a member of higher rank/status should be able to direct a younger less experienced player but if everyone mini-modded then there would be a reason for the mods_ thats what they're there for .
558790489831112746,MINECRAFT,minecraft,27,Yeah_ Sent that way to late
558790686694965277,MINECRAFT,minecraft,18,Poor = No Diamonds
558791699376242707,MINECRAFT,minecraft,264,<@!382208960918323200> Yeah_ I agree that there should be some help by more members but I'm saying that the way he was doing it was annoying. Mini-moding is a great way to let the mods not waste time with minor problems but if you keep doing it_ it becomes anoying
