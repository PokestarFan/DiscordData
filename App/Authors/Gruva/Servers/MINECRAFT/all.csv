559062175914786821,technical-bedrock,54,this is like an admist version that does bedrock seeds
559062426058752021,technical-bedrock,174,there will be a away to use it to automatically search for seeds with those structures in the range of spawn. But to be honest it's beyond my abilities to use that part of it
559062607437365250,technical-bedrock,105,<@413840989120102411> are you logged into the store with the same username that you bought the game with?

559062833132732416,technical-bedrock,9,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
559063505211359232,technical-bedrock,36,yeah_ shame there isn't a simple way
559065359697838111,technical-bedrock,20,these guys are magic
559077623796465665,technical-bedrock,78,or put everything in a ender chest (I mean everything) then jump into the void
559077980861890561,technical-bedrock,130,yes and no_ basically you can get that sort of thing but it's not simple and takes a lot of work and you're not meant to have them
559078068799668225,technical-bedrock,61,so the easiest thing is to say is no you can't get the blocks
559078138852671538,technical-bedrock,50,ender chest is eye of ender surrounded by obsidian
559078923992825857,technical-bedrock,14,no clue_ sorry
559114331900346389,technical-bedrock,27,mobs don't spawn on bedrock
560602137726550016,technical-bedrock,34,maybe not by design but a casualty
