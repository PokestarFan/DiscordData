558797267474186240,20,hey you little shits
558797293026017280,28,what ae we debating about rn
558797392149872675,29,oh it's that age old argument
558797521137434634,41,i don't have a finite opinion on abortion
558797937493409803,41,okay what are we debating rn lol i'm lost
558798188635750402,2,oh
558798253831880718,94,well any rational person is gonna say that if you want to die you should have the right to lol
558798372132225045,30,yeah but even considering that
558798394504511518,49,it's not something that should be mandated by law
558798562666872843,44,<@!325983451331166208> why do you think that
558798633261334528,15,i agree but why
558798734222426142,122,well if they are mentally unstable and they truly believe they cannot go on then who is the government to tell them not to
558798757974507571,36,nay even punish them if they survive
558799045347246090,117,if someone is chronically ill or they are suffering from something extreme to the point they will never live normally
558799086539636773,77,there really isn't something the government should be able to do to stop them
558799219230507029,62,<@186569274628767745> i dunno if that is the precedent it sets
558799824728752129,61,<@186569274628767745> that's not really comparable at all imo
558799985639030787,101,well this discussion isn't really about moving the right to control your own body or actions entirely
558800176827990046,136,your comparing the public option of euthenasia to just completely removing someones free will if another party believes they are at risk
558800245169848360,34,and imo that just isn't comparable
558800429019037711,24,that can't be the us lol
558800438229729282,2,oh
558800548095066124,37,we're talking about public euthanasia
558800564159381514,20,like a legal suicide
558800574536220673,20,or i assumed we were
558800902807486464,219,so cthulu you're saying that if we don't allow people to public euthanasia thus limiting body autonomy_ then that's comparable to just completely stripping someone of their free will if someone believes they are at risk
558800916187316244,31,that's what i'm getting atleast
558800998697795594,31,i honestly think trump will win
558801556955201547,3,omg
558801569500364835,23,noah what are you on rn
558801582309900290,17,are you on mobile
558801646860369951,51,why is my name so fucked up it looks fine on mobile
558801710995210241,44,cthulu you didn't prove yourself correc tlol
558801878901719048,58,chtulu i don't think we are on the same page right now lol
558801929187360778,61,because i feel like you think you proved something you didn't
558801935344467976,3,lol
558802094564311041,6,public
558802151510376470,40,you have to p*y for most private schools
558802160742039552,1,ðŸ˜·
558802247790624789,42,imagine having to pay to go to high school
558802291180830730,22,but this isn't college
558802302195073057,50,it's high school <:peepoIgnore:531724250781057035>
558802344201027646,4,wdym
558802355152486422,2,oh
558802430263951360,64,yeah actually i don't have a big opinion on public v private lol
558802459015905318,58,because i don't give that much of a shit about schools lol
558802498412871680,18,alright new debate
558802529299857409,52,what do you guys think of AOC's new '''green deal';;
558802579652608001,18,i disagree with it
558802615215849485,43,and i think she is latching too much too it
558802660619321368,31,soz we need to stick to one lol
558802719528452110,107,<@!378627967435145219> that's because apparently AOC thinks the world is fucking on the brink of ending LOL
558802793184362499,115,in an interview she said the earth had 12 years left or something if we dont quickly do something about the climate
558802816538509324,23,an obvious exaggeration
558802880187072533,37,let me find a source for that hold on
558802913800224779,34,because that sounds like hyperbole
558803032716869651,7,oh okay
558803068939141140,27,it's still hyperbole though
558803163138752522,74,the way AOC keeps framing it is that we have 12 years left as a collective
558803181606404120,32,and that's just exaggerating imo
558803340029460490,53,let me look at the entirety of the green deal hold on
558803362984886297,28,i haven't read it in a while
558803522091614218,7,okay so
558803551267192863,77,my main problem with the green deal rn is that is really fucking radical lmao
558803577150242826,30,>you sound like a fucking nazi
558803583102091285,8,cthulu__
558803604438384650,49,if you aren't gonna be civil why are you here lol
558803684427825173,37,STATISTICALLY inferior countries lmao
558803716225105920,32,geographically smaller countries
558803823871918142,35,imagine blocking someone in dehates
558803948316917765,47,aoc's green deal also supports universal income
558803964347285515,31,and i really disagree with that
558804130714615808,71,speaking of ubi (universal basic income) what do you guys think of that
558804162842853397,49,because to my knowledge it's a pretty split issue
558804210913902592,70,but i really don't think it could maintain if we actually instilled it
558804347857666049,76,well we have many studies on it and how it would affect the us in particular
558804444284846082,89,i really feel like universal basic income would just benefit the top more than the middle
558804464367173655,42,and that isn't what the US needs right now
558804552409808952,24,>neo-fascist governments
558804560433512448,8,cthulu__
558804727597367341,92,also lots of studies show that universal base income would only work as a temporary solution
558804754684182558,50,and the us doesn't really need temporary right now
558804756387201047,3,lol
558804905360621578,33,cthulu that's not neo-fascism LOL
558805260865634325,57,why even come to debates if you're gonna block people lol
558805340603547688,47,that shows you didn't come here for an argument
558805358601044010,36,just to try and prove yourself right
558805373113335851,8,not cash
558805593318752258,63,well anyways what do you guys think about universal base income
558805717478277123,10,omg cthulu
558805734448431105,27,do you know what fascism is
558805739230199818,7,;l'skjg
558805947041185813,10,cthulu lol
558805990607159316,71,if you just came here to be a baby when we don't agree then go to memes
558807030287171585,21,<@186569274628767745>
558808026421788673,115,can we move on to a different debate lol because obviously no one here is interested in changing their mind on this
558808281078956034,58,<@186569274628767745> your sort of hyperbolizing right now
558808289228488714,7,*you're
558808335277752320,48,you're contorting two different things right now
558809218166030348,30,bdsm is cool and frankly? epic
558809265729437699,7,no cody
558809305827246091,30,i want nonconsensual dominance
558809333408989196,44,i want someone to nonconsenually dominate me
558809440485376010,44,i love hoe we go from rising fascism to bdsm
558809442427338775,3,lol
558810195216695296,96,<@!168726186313121793> sorry but you didn't immediately agree with him after reading one article
558810205224173578,7,bloCkEd
558810662663487498,7,i agree
558810669538082846,9,i mean___
558810710243672064,15,okay new debate
558810745723158532,35,do you think trump will win in 2020
558810747191296001,6,debate
558810894126284813,93,i've been reading more and more about trump's 2020 campaign and i really think trump will win
558810944969506829,18,oh god it's andrew
558811080030289941,50,well i mean look at the democratic candidates lmao
558811104118046723,50,they really don't have a strong hand on their side
558811463796654090,295,<@!212217794639560704> but multiple economic models have shown that if we were voting right now_ trump would likely win with a landslideNLNLyou would imagine that with trumps' approval rating being so low that he wouldn't_ but the positive effects he has instilled on our economy cannot go ignored
558811511359930373,39,and definitely have given him a step up
558811515986116608,7,ya know
558811541986607138,18,are you now cthulu
558811543807066112,1,.
558811552619167779,6,oh god
558811577273286679,15,kanye would win
558811590011518986,13,for the memes
558811625147072525,56,people would vote for him as a joke and he would win lol
558811750334464011,105,<@!212217794639560704> read this https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/21/trump-economy-election-1230495
558811815719731211,42,andrew yang isn't fit to be president lmao
558811922091212812,106,yang seems to_ imo_ have a fundamental misunderstanding as to how he would put his UBI proposal into place
558811965137485850,57,and that's not to even mention the many problems with UBI
558812004312285195,28,that wouldn't solve anything
558812227436544008,124,also another opinion that may be unpopular but i believe that as of recent it has become a trend to be 'fashionably liberal'
558812238157316109,19,ya know what i mean
558812265525280768,3,wtf
558812651736793088,334,<@!212217794639560704> i see so many people say that the positive effects of trumps' economy are all because of obama and his administration but i really disagree with that NLNLand it's pretty cowardice to say that trump has literally done NOTHING to improve our country when many of trumps' NEW policies have been shown to be effective
558813274452262912,254,read this article andrewNLI know it's Fox but it does a nice job of detailing trumps' biggest accomplishments over his current presidency https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trumps-first-two-years-in-office-a-look-at-his-biggest-achievements-and-failures
558813498692468757,93,<@!212217794639560704> also what do you mean that his policies only stand for short term gain
558813525779283998,42,because i feel like that is untrue as well
558813749599797289,49,i can tell you exactly who WON'T win the election
558813776271376384,53,elizabeth warren <a:OMEGAOMEGALUL:403720858234781707>
558814320268673025,41,no soz we are talking about candidates rn
558814565979389975,14,oh my god lmao
558814617107955742,53,at the moment the US only has 2 republican candidates
558814666743087104,73,realistically 1 because bill weld doesn't seem to have much of a presence
558814833882038273,52,i dunno how i feel about the kavanaugh v. ford thing
558815523391930378,18,alright new debate
558815550097195011,37,what do you guys think of gun control
558815576836014080,6,debate
558815604539129856,2,oh
558815729642766347,115,so many people are out here just saying we should outright ban guns and shit but that just isn't how it should work
558815967719718944,88,<@353300924757704704> well the right to bear arms is a constitutional right first of all
558815996744302592,69,also if we banned all guns people would still just get them illegally
558816020555497473,22,similar to prohibition
558816197316182016,92,<@!212217794639560704> okay you're intentionally misconstruing my point you know what i mean
558816279314563088,85,if we ban something country wide people are still going to find another way to get it
558816377583173632,72,but i think that we definitely need stricter gun laws but that's a given
558817164577079316,199,so many people act like guns are just useless killing machines and that there is no fundamental barrier stopping them from just giving them up but guns are something lots of people can't live without
558817298584961036,67,and people like to underestimate how laced gun culture is in the US
558817324724125699,35,people won't just give them up lmao
558817799254835205,151,<@353300924757704704> i mean when you start to limit what KIND of guns people are allowed to own that's when it gets into more moralistic territory imo
558817971133480960,80,andrew chat isn't even fast anymore damb <:GWseremePeepoLife:402867847950237698>
558817999427993600,2,oh
558818003899121667,9,okay neat
558818201304170536,180,<@353300924757704704> i think the US needs to focus on our already placed laws instead of trying to enforce something as widespread and complicated as banning a certain kind of hun
558818209986248725,4,*gun
558818333512826898,35,that's another thing actually chaos
558818399409405991,115,lots of people think that banning something like the AR-15 specifically would just stop school shootings but i mean
558818459421638666,116,you could carry out a school shooting with a regular gunNLand guns that look similar to an AR can be used for hunting
558818551872487487,102,it's a lot more complicated than just banning one kind of gun and all of a sudden gun violence is down
558818604741820426,27,i just said that drew but .
558818609795956747,6,go awf
558818799952855040,92,i think one of the main things sparking school shootings is the media coverage of the events
558818912989478928,163,howerver i think american media outlets are learning their lesson because they have really been trying to make sure that the NZ shooter doesn't get any recognition
558818945608712216,29,but even with that being said
558819014294634496,80,the reason most school shooters commit those acts is for attention and notoriety
558819030769598475,34,so you take away that aspect of it
558819052852740097,56,and all of a sudden it won't look that appealing anymore
558819084104499223,74,that's a pretty black and white way of putting it but you know what i mean
558819137221033984,41,<@202347079979368448> i watched the video
558819220612317185,58,wait are we still talking about guns or the holocaust lmao
558819247791276038,69,<@202347079979368448> no i was just saying i've watched the video too
558819270310494208,4,damn
558819355274641413,151,<@66164051062816768> well NZ already had strict as fuck gun laws but after this we can only expect it to be practically impossible to purchase a weapon
558819416649891850,4,yeah
558819469078691847,71,because from what i heard they are putting this into action pretty soon
558819563853316097,104,which is pretty crazy considering america's inability to instill laws and regulations at a regular speed
558819581251289108,33,but that's neither here nor there
558819583230869526,4,lmao
558819912588460067,215,<@353300924757704704> well that's because just it's a multifaceted problem that can't be solved just by doing thatNLNLa potentional school shooter could easily find a gun illegally_ steal it from a family member_ etc.
558819938211725312,55,it's so much harder than just making guns harder to get
558820139563352070,185,<@353300924757704704> well a plausible solution hasn't really been found yet because there are so many ways to get a gun and so many reasons that someone would want to shoot up a school
558820164498358282,38,that's why it's such a debatable topic
558820211361448002,70,because there are many solutions that all light chip away at the issue
558820234090250241,38,without actually solving it completely
558820276620623892,25,that's not optimal at all
558820398465024020,81,you guys really think just taking away everyone's guns is the right solution lmao
558820565574615040,144,so many seem to just think that guns are these killing machines that only brutes and dumbasses own but really gun culture definitely has a value
558820593433182218,46,and people like to ignore that for some reason
558821870842019860,54,<@202347079979368448> how is our constitution outdated
558821875468206141,7,or shit
558822019806789682,86,the 'main parts of it' are fundamental rights that we as citizens just deserve to have
558822449643257877,139,i mean i believe the difficult reality some people don't want to face is that there is never going to be a way to fully stop mass shootings
558822500340072449,86,if an insane person really wants to shoot up a school they can find a way to get a gun
558822537090564098,7,i agree
558822624784941057,141,and the mental health angle sort of reaches a dead end when you realize you can't involuntarily force someone to seek mental health treatment
558824218679050260,47,<@353300924757704704> what are you referring to
558824252657369088,49,are you referring to assault weapons like AR's or
558824382781456424,45,<@66164051062816768> i agree with you lmao dw
558824513199013909,72,also a weapon that by definition is customized for assault like an ar-15
558824582124142613,70,well soz i see what you are saying but you do sound a little misguided
558824630744514566,31,chaos you know what i mean lmao
558824768409829445,297,"Drawing from federal and state law definitions_ the term assault weapon refers primarily to semi-automatic rifles_ pistols_ and shotguns that are able to accept detachable magazines and possess one or more other features. Some jurisdictions define revolving cylinder shotguns as assault weapons."
558824831773311026,4,that
558824846671216652,30,that is what i'm trying to say
558824895908282368,86,so soz are you referring to those kinds of guns not being needed <@353300924757704704>
558825092382064642,87,i mean assault weapons already can't be bought without more extensive background checks
558825209055150110,40,also an ar-15 is a popular hunting rifle
558825431134896168,78,<@166496803733110784> alexx lmao do you know big the US is in comparison to NZ
558825471794610207,74,you can't compare their time to put laws in effect in comparison to the US
558825516879314944,1,^
558825613847429130,30,well it's a multifaceted issue
558825714770640936,76,that's not to even mention that NZ already had stronger gun laws than the US
558825743358885898,29,and a shooting still happened
558825892974166019,123,people seem to want to blame mass shootings ENTIRELY on guns and how we get them but really it is so much greater than that
558826287267971072,104,<@66164051062816768> well also you can't really voluntarily force someone to get mental health treatment
558826332537094164,76,and it's not always obvious when someone is at risk of committing a shooting
558826480122069030,163,people really want to just throw a giant blanket 'solution' on mass shootings but really there is always going to be a way for someone to get a gun and hurt people
558826568420556804,12,yeah it does
558826633264496651,35,you can't compare drugs to guns lol
558826703460499467,36,they are entirely different entities
558826739221135361,45,and they both have different places in the US
558826766114750464,4,yeah
558826865897373700,154,and alex i see what you're saying but you really do seem to just be throwing blanket solutions ontop of issues that can't be solved by one practical thing
558827009199833090,162,<@66164051062816768> well it's making the assumption that if someone is going to commit a mass shooting that they already have a history of mental health problems
558827017550954543,26,and that isn't always true
558827038656561154,18,atleast documented
558827113180954635,6,no soz
558827165899161612,66,but it's definitely harder to get one as opposed to something like
558827177756459050,22,a handgun or something
558827320463589397,59,<@!110898859298787328> here only tags the people on discord
558827347961446400,47,everyone tags everyone in the server regardless
558827537946378250,4,well
558827556933992484,42,we didn't seem to accomplish anything lmao
558827800547688449,85,<@353300924757704704> there are more uses for automatic guns than just killing people
558827990197469204,12,and honestly
558827996006580254,11,for example
558828048170876948,88,you have to have a specific license to get an assault weapon in the us right now anyways
558828050888916992,4,iirc
558828201389064202,121,and an ar-15_ a gun so many people want to label an assault rifle_ is actually used more for hunting and things like that
558828239276081212,35,and even then it's difficult to get
558828390291865600,20,well not hard to get
558828429492092949,43,but in relativity to a handgun or something
558828449947451404,24,it takes a bit more work
558828622102921217,133,also so many people underestimate the level of countrywide REVOLT there would be if we tried to simply take away and ban peoples guns
558828694383099935,43,people would 100 percent not stand for that
558828784401383424,12,sure why not
558829290813259776,26,i know nothing about birds
558829297507237888,4,haha
