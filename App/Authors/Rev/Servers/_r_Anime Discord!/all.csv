558755789431505035,anime,37,You have my sympathies and apologies.
558755840341966858,anime,35,I _never said_ it was a _good_ idea
558756212334657537,anime,74,Hate me for bringing it up the first place instead. It's more therapeutic.
558757849908641794,anime,29,What about Fate/strange fake?
558757976777949194,anime,16,Yeah_ by Narita.
558758040728371200,anime,98,Nasu gave him feedback on it and everything; isn't the idea of Fate that most things can be canon?
558758219992924202,anime,109,I think F/sf is definitely after Fate/Zero_ at least. I know some people were trying to fit it on a timeline.
558758705479286784,anime,49,"why you do this" // because Narita is a calling.
558758869908586515,anime,201,Also because_ though I'm not someone who's actually into/experienced Fate proper_ I know that f/sf is well-liked so far by fate fans both in and outside of Japan. (also Vol 5 is coming out next month).
558759628939460619,anime,165,Hm_ this claims that Nasu said Strange/fake is similar to FGO in 2017 <https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/65e3fm/nasus_blog_april_15th_2017_clarified_the/>
558761816675581972,anime,142,Eh_ I gave in and started reading F/sf Vol 1 despite not having played/read/seen any of the other storylines_ don't let your dreams be dreams.
558761947441528832,anime,43,Yeah_ but this is Fate we're talking about.
558761953074610196,anime,7,> sense

558792251979989007,anime,31,And this s supposed to sell me?
558792346037256197,anime,25,No_ you've still lost me.
558792630595616768,anime,86,Baccano!_ Kids on the Slope /// what I'm hearing is "jazz" and I am here for The Jazz.
558798142443880450,anime,25,> Naritaverse on the moon
558798420207468564,anime,144,There's a great Baccano! x Durarara!! oneshot fic I read once where it was set in the future--far enough that humanity had colonies on the moon.
558798529234075648,anime,43,The fic itself was set on Earth_ but still.
558798980516151300,anime,38,Mecha designs... gotta love The Big O.
558806076888318004,anime,37,Moribito <:ginsan:529569462886858772>
558806436310810634,anime,118,Moribito Episode 11 is my favorite Moribito episode probably (and ranks up there as one of my favorite anime episodes)
558806608168222731,anime,50,It helps that I really like Tanda_ a true Best Guy
558807401256714251,anime,0,
558807442318819328,anime,18,Epusode 11 = 11/11
558811343969583104,anime,111,Everyone always likes to praise Reigen for protecting his head; no one ever thinks to give Tanda similar credit
558811381453815810,anime,0,
558812111845851146,anime,60,TL;DR Tanda is terrific_ thanks for tolerating my Tanda Talk
558812148407468033,anime,29,(Ted Talks are so old school)
558812422962413588,anime,177,I have a mighty need to read the rest of the Moribito novels...@Yen Press if you're listening_ I'd definitely be interested in one of those beautiful special edition releases...
558812749132726282,anime,113,Balsa and Tanda are just _so good_ as MC and secondary; as individuals_ and as individuals with a shared history.
558812900614078487,anime,103,It's been so long since I watched Moribito from start to finish; it really deserves a rewatch sometime.
558817043743244289,anime,31,<@176841556156743683> You rang?
558828502846144532,anime,31,(Whoop_ went and took a shower)
558828642998681621,anime,120,I was saying yesterday that I thought Noein had good directing/camerawork_ and I think that's true for Moribito as well.
558829148777349120,anime,180,If we look at Episode 11_ my fav Moribito episode mentioned earlier...in that episode_ it sort of feels like the 'camera' is acting as if the setting and its actors are live action
558829591771480075,anime,192,You get lots of good 1st person perspective in that episode_ and generally the camera movements feel quite natural/well-planned. And I definitely agree about the sense of 'depth' to its shots.
558830233881673768,anime,243,Hm_ I think maybe the lighting and shadows help with that 'realism' feeling; obviously the art leans more toward semi-realism than it does 'cartoony'_ but the lighting_ shadows...well_ again-they feel both natural and help with sense of depth.
558830273110736896,anime,0,
558830357764505610,anime,81,(From episode 11 ^^ again_ because I also love the lighting used in that episode)
558830976663552030,anime,229,(also_ that one screenshot I shared earlier of Balsa watching over Tanda(s) -- I absolutely adore that moment and screenshot it all the time whenever Moribito comes up; possibly because I adore the shot composition of that frame)
558831203134734366,anime,141,There's depth not just in 'people'/'stage' shots (i.e scenes with lots of characters)_ but often depth to the landscape/backdrop art as well.
558831252569063475,anime,0,
558831340460441600,anime,115,i'm not _sure_ if that's a spoiler (the point of the screenshot is to show off the landscape art) but just in case.
558831359607701525,anime,30,(It's from episode 11 as well)
558831696670097429,anime,110,Re that sakugabooru clip; there's an HD compilation of some of Moribito's fight scenes on YT I always revisit.

558831898118455326,anime,137,Whoops_ sorry /// "Heads up to anyone interested. Evangelion is premiering on Netflix in like 3 minutes." PSA copied from above the video
558832052087291904,anime,29,(didn't mean to push that up)
558832260904648708,anime,133,(shit_ speaking of good shot composition and background art_ the first frame of the 1st fight in the video above is already glorious.
558832680251293706,anime,200,*I should say that I tend to appreciate Moribito's interior lighting more often; sometimes the lighting in outside scenes - particularly ones with blue skies/sunny weather - can feel a bit too bright.
558832928411484161,anime,19,Oh boy_ here we go.
558833044203503636,anime,4,6.21
558833070938128397,anime,12,June 21_ ey.
558834073368526851,anime,71,Psh_ I don't even have Netflix so I'm mostly shrugging and carrying on.
558834223310569476,anime,53,The reverse isekai'd field_ perhaps_ is more diverse.
558834430710644736,anime,79,<@113912504542953474> I sure do love me some autodefenestration in the mornings
558834844839444480,anime,86,Rance I can't tell if you're referencing some sort of meme or attempting to start one.
558834898408964127,anime,12,i.e. 'What'.
558835019104387093,anime,5,Oh...
558835172481564672,anime,12,> necromancy
558835258921975828,anime,89,Meanwhile_ there's a reverse isekai where the one isekai'd into Earth is a necromancer...
558835403931648010,anime,19,Isn't there always?
558836751091761214,anime,117,<@511249794325282818> 6 minutes (?) into Moribito  and already  you belong to Balsa; she's just that good_ isn't she.
558837065706373143,anime,18,Balsa pfp? _do it_
558837931775623168,anime,25,A very good thing indeed.
558837950637670430,anime,17,I'm proud of you.
559030973023518723,anime,184,I liked firo a lot more once I started reading the novels--not that I didn't necessarily like him in the anime_ I just thought he was less interesting compared to the other characters.
559031087083290654,anime,194,But in reading the first few volumes (that the anime adapted) I realized they kinda made him a bit more shounen protagy then he actually is in those novels. 1930!Firo in the LNs is a little shit
559031756263784448,anime,207,Haha_ they're not dressed like they are in the anime when they have that moment of realization in 2001 (they decide to sew bells into their clothes) but still good stuff. You guys...it took you that long...?
559031849804890114,anime,56,Volume 5's 2001 color insert (the moment of realization)
559032324394582031,anime,170,I wasn't invested in the Netflix announcement in the first place_ but I get being ticked that the countdown amounted to an announcement of a future date and nothing more.
559032442011254802,anime,63,That trailer seemed to be painting NGE as an action show too...
559032956786704384,anime,102,Haha_ I get it. Much of that lack of investment on my part was due to the fact I don't have Netflix...
559035377134862358,anime,164,I'm not saying it shouldn't have shown action! It's just that action scenes/shots of the mecha or the pilots yelling were the only shots that trailer showed_ right?
559036117152956448,anime,256,"That's the way EVA has always been sold" // Mm_ but to sell it this way now Netflix must be banking on the amount of people out there who are totally unfamiliar with EVA -- which_ to be fair_ is probably a lot of Netflix's audience_ okay I grant you that.
559038223272378368,anime,212,See_ I am physically incapable of being someone who tries to watch as many seasonals as possible. I pick the one or two shows that interest me_ start them_ and inevitably fall behind as the show continues to air.
559038718984323082,anime,209,I'm sure there are more anime out there you'd like_ but the same goes for me; my rate of anime consumption has dropped a lot from what it was back in high school. It's faster to consume manga and LNs for sure.
