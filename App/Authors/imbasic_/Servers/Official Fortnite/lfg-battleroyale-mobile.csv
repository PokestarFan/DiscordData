560625368931762205,490,Second it takes patience. But if you really want to better yourself as quick as possible_ search up HUD layout videos and change your HUD accordingly to your preference_ your device etc._ then you want to watch streamers and content creators such as Flash fn_ AdamXLegend_ DuckyTheGamer_ and any other people you find along your feed_ do a bunch of pub matches with your new HUD once comfortable and alternate to practicing moves and tricks in creative as well (90s_ rfw_  double rfw_ etc.)
