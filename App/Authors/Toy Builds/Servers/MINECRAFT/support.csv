560638234506428417,70,<@323222999413293057> did you try to uninstall and reinstall the game?
560638523716272128,87,It’s been hell over the past two days with 1.11 and realms not working it’s frustrating

560639301076123654,56,I just can’t figure out why my realm won’t upload worlds
560639637605974027,160,Yeah I got back onto 1.10 and I was playing my realm a few hours ago until I replaced the world with another now I cannot replace the world back to my first one
560639894796632075,116,Nope_ I didn’t open any of my worlds in 1.11_ I fact I’ve tried all of my worlds_ neither won’t upload onto my realm
560640176263790622,111,I’ve emailed Mojang but the according to there support site they’re still replying from emails from March 1st 😦
560640645849415691,119,Hopefully it’ll work in the morning_ if not I’ll probably cancel my realm subscription until I get an email from Mojang
560640737579106314,83,I still have my worlds and there 100% playable I just can’t upload them to my realm
