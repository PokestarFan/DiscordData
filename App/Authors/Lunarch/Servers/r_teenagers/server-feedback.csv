560643743515017237,131,Reactions are now disabled in <#556961572287938582>_ and we don't allow them because most emotes are used for non serious purposes.
560645556125433856,223,We used to have them enabled but they are too easily abused to make users feel bad or play on any already present insecurities about coming to the channel for help. I love reacts too but it's not something we can risk here.
