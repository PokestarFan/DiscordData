560643743515017237,r/teenagers,server-feedback,131,Reactions are now disabled in <#556961572287938582>_ and we don't allow them because most emotes are used for non serious purposes.

560645556125433856,r/teenagers,server-feedback,223,We used to have them enabled but they are too easily abused to make users feel bad or play on any already present insecurities about coming to the channel for help. I love reacts too but it's not something we can risk here.
