558820408212586508,r/teenagers,debates,173,I swear the single most infuriating subject to debate is gun because people don't seem to even educate themselves on the most fundamental information surrounding the systems
558820520922185729,r/teenagers,debates,96,And fall back to cookie cutter arguments that even they don't know what that means to justify it
558820533094055956,r/teenagers,debates,7,I don't
558820602048413736,r/teenagers,debates,51,"more background checks" is pretty much meaningless

558820790003564553,r/teenagers,debates,141,but forcing law enforcement agencies (even though they already are IIRC) to co-operate and provide more information to the federal government
558820873587392638,r/teenagers,debates,68,agian you don't know what you're talking about here and it's showing

558821171185975306,r/teenagers,debates,34,That is psychologically incorrect.
558821409824964643,r/teenagers,debates,73,ah yes because it's impossible for people to exhibit anti-social behavior
558821446810468383,r/teenagers,debates,49,I need a source to talk about how the sky is blue
558821577710370831,r/teenagers,debates,23,I was not attacking you

558821674313711656,r/teenagers,debates,93,The Federal system is good enough_ the issue is some state have different rules sorrunding it
558821703849869314,r/teenagers,debates,48,so "more background checks" doesn't fix anything
558821750469689354,r/teenagers,debates,73,and "shifting through social media" is a massive constitutional violaiton
558821788604301313,r/teenagers,debates,83,okay how are you going to find a background on someone who doesnt have a backgroudn
558821810821660683,r/teenagers,debates,20,Please explain to me

558821897152757770,r/teenagers,debates,36,literally last updated ~30 years ago
558822101289795605,r/teenagers,debates,26,that doesn't mean anything
558822180683776001,r/teenagers,debates,116,the U.S. constition basically functions the same as most constitutional republics with only a feew small differences
558822216889008140,r/teenagers,debates,12,I don't feel
558822288078798883,r/teenagers,debates,64,Simply put_ you can not find a background if one does not exist.
558822353409277952,r/teenagers,debates,88,So "more background checks" means nothing because you cant have "more background checks"
558822365451124736,r/teenagers,debates,4,Why?
558823136502743051,r/teenagers,debates,321,the U.S. is philosophically different than most other nations. The U.S. is founded on rights that a government should not infringe on_ like the right to bare arms_ right to free speech. Other nations have it so that they are privileges granted by the government and can be encrouched upon or modified at any point in time
558823734857826305,r/teenagers,debates,4,What
558823748946624523,r/teenagers,debates,20,The fuck do you mean

558824972454199297,r/teenagers,debates,88,It is impossible to get an automatic rifle in the U.S. unless you have $50_000+ to spare
558824994902114344,r/teenagers,debates,19,and a buyer to find
558825023238832157,r/teenagers,debates,14,Semi-automatic
558825029798854663,r/teenagers,debates,7,okay so

558825273106366486,r/teenagers,debates,26,<@166496803733110784> why?
558825465112952839,r/teenagers,debates,39,Banning semi automatic rifles is stupid
558825621497708573,r/teenagers,debates,34,Gun laws isn't how you change that
558825759481921537,r/teenagers,debates,65,more legislation would literally not put a dent in the statistics
558825793485013013,r/teenagers,debates,32,You want to reduce gun violence?
558825815043735567,r/teenagers,debates,33,you need to work on social reform
558825875865468939,r/teenagers,debates,45,<@166496803733110784> a lot greater like what

558826110784241664,r/teenagers,debates,24,What are you looking for
558826179277357077,r/teenagers,debates,10,Won't work
558826203847458816,r/teenagers,debates,31,without nationalized healthcare
558826223388721152,r/teenagers,debates,37,struck down immediately in the courts
558826263838588929,r/teenagers,debates,53,plus there is an issue on the fact of medical privacy
558826370252144641,r/teenagers,debates,13,Red Flag Laws
558826411704582154,r/teenagers,debates,48,But even then I still think that might be shitty
558826508798394368,r/teenagers,debates,7,Depends
558826533981257760,r/teenagers,debates,49,how do you find out if their mental health is bad
558826591443222528,r/teenagers,debates,48,and what do you determine is "bad mental health"
558826894628225024,r/teenagers,debates,133,What do you determine to be"bad mental health" and how to you suspect the government find out about this issues <@166496803733110784>
558827035267432471,r/teenagers,debates,15,yes that's true
558827052044648458,r/teenagers,debates,26,but here's what i'm saying
558827068394176514,r/teenagers,debates,32,even if there is a document case
558827076254433320,r/teenagers,debates,19,HOW DO YOU FIND IT?
558827206068011018,r/teenagers,debates,163,To get into the United States Military you have to waive over your medical records to the DoD_ but MEPS can't actually find your records for a multitude of reasons
558827332845043712,r/teenagers,debates,140,and the same would apply to any system that involves using the federal government to find medical records in relation to firearm legislation
558827562969595904,r/teenagers,debates,33,<@166496803733110784> you theree?

558828129431584768,r/teenagers,debates,82,I'm not sure about those particular laws but its ridiculously expensive and timely
558828272071344129,r/teenagers,debates,18,AR-15 hard to get?
558828285010771987,r/teenagers,debates,20,Depends on the state
558828321492959262,r/teenagers,debates,19,In New Jersey? Yes.
558828343177379861,r/teenagers,debates,19,Texas? Probably not
558828386081046550,r/teenagers,debates,41,In fact it's banned by name in new jersey
558828396201902081,r/teenagers,debates,20,so people buy clones
558828426023403550,r/teenagers,debates,38,but those clones are still hard to get
558828462895529996,r/teenagers,debates,31,If we are talking about murders
558828493161365514,r/teenagers,debates,52,you are more likely to be punched or kicked to death
558828509695574018,r/teenagers,debates,25,then be killed by a rifle
558828577257422851,r/teenagers,debates,35,that is not correct in all contexts
558828623654813706,r/teenagers,debates,80,and yes in some cases a single punch can kill you before you even hit the ground
558836887805100032,r/teenagers,debates,6,yooooo
558836899318333440,r/teenagers,debates,24,i just learned something

558836959519440906,r/teenagers,debates,40,and the "Home" key goes to the beginning
558841227387338762,r/teenagers,debates,38,I wouldn't classify saudi as developed
558841325072416808,r/teenagers,debates,70,MBS knows oil is going to run dry/be worth nothing one day (inshallah)
558841386263117835,r/teenagers,debates,54,So he's been reforming to give saudi a fighting chance
558841468626796547,r/teenagers,debates,3,No?
558846131044352000,r/teenagers,debates,111,<@!378627967435145219> on what basis to you allege violations of the law of armed conflcit against Saudi Arabia
558846204147007498,r/teenagers,debates,86,from my studying most of them alleged from NGO are either false/aren't LOAC violations
558847442049826828,r/teenagers,debates,25,That's not the same thing
558847495359168534,r/teenagers,debates,26,and citation on "approval"
558847664880353290,r/teenagers,debates,11,more really

558847961027575818,r/teenagers,debates,23,we thought that in 2011
558848006317932555,r/teenagers,debates,11,and in 2009
558848714475700234,r/teenagers,debates,81,okay_ who are these war criminals that saudi is supporting <@!378627967435145219>
558848876765773825,r/teenagers,debates,54,because i bet most rebel forces count as war criminals
