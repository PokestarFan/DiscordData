560624853645000715,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,60,I've been doodling around with making my own compiler today.
560625090169929739,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,124,I decided not to tokenize all of the characters and digits in identifiers and numeric literals 'cause I kinda don't have to?
560625148944711700,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,106,And going out of my way to do that makes a lot more work to put those things back together properly later.
560625169677287424,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,34,A side effect is I get to do this:
560625187469656074,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,47,```NL0xafe_starts_with_a_number :int = 0xafe;```
560625237847310336,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,19,Tokenizer's output:
560625277525426196,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,468,```NLLine:                        Token:                   Token Type:NL00001    0xafe_starts_with_a_number                  ALPHANUMERICNL00001                             :                   TYPE_MARKERNL00001                           int                  ALPHANUMERICNL00001                             =                    ASSIGNMENTNL00001                         0xafe           HEXADECIMAL_LITERALNL00001                             ;                   END_OF_LINE```
560625674063183872,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,205,My thinking is I can define numbers in the grammar in such a way that the parser looks for BINARY_LITERAL_ HEXADECIMAL_LITERAL_ or DECIMAL_LITERAL tokens instead of caring about the contents of the tokens.
560625744573759489,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,80,'Cause the lexer already ensures those will be put together and tagged properly.
560628306182144001,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,97,The parser would care if it were looking to make sure that the token matched the production rule.
560628546104721428,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,39,```NLnumber = 1-9NLnumber = 1-9 number```
560628553712926735,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,16,that kinda thing
560628620008357891,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,63,the parser would need to check that the token fits the terminal
560628758306881622,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,20,the production rules
560628782440906752,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,24,for how to build numbers
560628950120792073,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,35,i think that's what i was thinking/
560628987722858496,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,44,since i'm not splitting up numbers per digit
560629037878476800,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,44,i just define the production rule like this:
560629144233181185,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,84,```NLnumber = BINARY_LITERALNLnumber = HEXADECIMAL_LITERALNLnumber = DECIMAL_LITERAL```
560629187031859211,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,82,and give the parser some way to understand that i'm talking about token type there
560629264974610442,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,66,Consider the case where I tokenized all of the digits in a number.
560629312265519122,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,80,The parser would have to realize all of the digits were part of a single number.
560629409372045334,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,118,Meaning it'd have to check the contents of the tokens to make sure they matched the terminals in the production rules.
560629758489001984,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,60,I'm not sure why you're having a hard time understanding me.
560629793889058846,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,45,In the case where 999 got tokenized to 9 9 9.
560629971949715467,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,118,Then it'd need to look at the contents of the tokens rather than just being happy that they're numeric literal tokens.
560630103969890305,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,21,I'm doing the latter.
560630518572646411,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,185,The interesting bit was I wound up in a situation where I can start identifiers with numbers_ which is only interesting because I don't recall seeing any serious languages ever do that.
560630532661313536,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,17,But it's trivial.
560630618539687949,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,44,So I'm wondering why that isn't more common.
560630941073276929,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,5,Well.
560631096358993930,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,67,If someone makes a variable like 0x1af6gfe43_ that's his own fault.
560631123722633216,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,40,Just like using single letter variables.
560631169050214401,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,63,Or variables whose names have nothing to do with their purpose.
560631307693195292,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,9,It's not.
560631317255946249,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,16,That's my point.
560631384083791909,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,3,Uh.
560631386906689554,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,3,No.
560631405990772746,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,29,That was an exaggerated case.
560631484097232896,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,43,But I might want something like 2hard2code.
560631544281300993,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,39,In that case it's not confusing at all.
560631589743362048,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,38,You're kind of missing the point_ tbh.
560631648966672385,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,26,Something like that_ sure.
560631684047831071,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,22,Yeah_ and that's fine.
560631795914375188,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,144,Every sane developer will follow decent naming conventions outside of the few situations where having a number at the start makes perfect sense.
560631809268776960,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,26,And the insane devs_ well.
560631820857901087,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,24,There's no helping them.
560631870921113600,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,54,They already have plenty of tools to shoot their feet.
560631909152063497,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,7,I mean.
560631972183932929,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,97,I had originally thought it was because it was just too hard to get compilers to understand that.
560632016404742155,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,56,The topic got swept under the rug with that explanation.
560632067885629470,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,58,But now that I'm looking at it_ it's clearly not an issue.
560632111590015018,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,7,I mean.
560632181404467201,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,43,I don't think it really makes things worse.
560632344587796510,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,3,ken
560632349654515743,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,9,nice edit
560633203573129237,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,70,People already have enormous freedom to make horrible variables names.
560633254110298122,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,62,We've hit diminishing returns for how much worse they can get.
560633355373379605,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,67,I'd rather not be opinionated about how good devs can use the tool.
