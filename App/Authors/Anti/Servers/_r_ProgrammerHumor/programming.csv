560624853645000715,60,I've been doodling around with making my own compiler today.
560625090169929739,124,I decided not to tokenize all of the characters and digits in identifiers and numeric literals 'cause I kinda don't have to?
560625148944711700,106,And going out of my way to do that makes a lot more work to put those things back together properly later.
560625169677287424,34,A side effect is I get to do this:
560625187469656074,47,```NL0xafe_starts_with_a_number :int = 0xafe;```
560625237847310336,19,Tokenizer's output:
560625277525426196,468,```NLLine:                        Token:                   Token Type:NL00001    0xafe_starts_with_a_number                  ALPHANUMERICNL00001                             :                   TYPE_MARKERNL00001                           int                  ALPHANUMERICNL00001                             =                    ASSIGNMENTNL00001                         0xafe           HEXADECIMAL_LITERALNL00001                             ;                   END_OF_LINE```
560625674063183872,205,My thinking is I can define numbers in the grammar in such a way that the parser looks for BINARY_LITERAL_ HEXADECIMAL_LITERAL_ or DECIMAL_LITERAL tokens instead of caring about the contents of the tokens.
560625744573759489,80,'Cause the lexer already ensures those will be put together and tagged properly.
560628306182144001,97,The parser would care if it were looking to make sure that the token matched the production rule.
560628546104721428,39,```NLnumber = 1-9NLnumber = 1-9 number```
560628553712926735,16,that kinda thing
560628620008357891,63,the parser would need to check that the token fits the terminal
560628758306881622,20,the production rules
560628782440906752,24,for how to build numbers
560628950120792073,35,i think that's what i was thinking/
560628987722858496,44,since i'm not splitting up numbers per digit
560629037878476800,44,i just define the production rule like this:
560629144233181185,84,```NLnumber = BINARY_LITERALNLnumber = HEXADECIMAL_LITERALNLnumber = DECIMAL_LITERAL```
560629187031859211,82,and give the parser some way to understand that i'm talking about token type there
560629264974610442,66,Consider the case where I tokenized all of the digits in a number.
560629312265519122,80,The parser would have to realize all of the digits were part of a single number.
560629409372045334,118,Meaning it'd have to check the contents of the tokens to make sure they matched the terminals in the production rules.
560629758489001984,60,I'm not sure why you're having a hard time understanding me.
560629793889058846,45,In the case where 999 got tokenized to 9 9 9.
