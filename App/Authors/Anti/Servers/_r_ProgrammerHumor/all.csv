560624853645000715,programming,60,I've been doodling around with making my own compiler today.
560625090169929739,programming,124,I decided not to tokenize all of the characters and digits in identifiers and numeric literals 'cause I kinda don't have to?
560625148944711700,programming,106,And going out of my way to do that makes a lot more work to put those things back together properly later.
560625169677287424,programming,34,A side effect is I get to do this:
560625187469656074,programming,47,```NL0xafe_starts_with_a_number :int = 0xafe;```
560625237847310336,programming,19,Tokenizer's output:
560625277525426196,programming,468,```NLLine:                        Token:                   Token Type:NL00001    0xafe_starts_with_a_number                  ALPHANUMERICNL00001                             :                   TYPE_MARKERNL00001                           int                  ALPHANUMERICNL00001                             =                    ASSIGNMENTNL00001                         0xafe           HEXADECIMAL_LITERALNL00001                             ;                   END_OF_LINE```
