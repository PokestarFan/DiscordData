559005887948259339,91,also I dislike Voxelmap for a single reason. Fucking crashes every time I move a few chunks
559005909221769245,23,but its the best we got
559005913785040945,3,;-;
560637184139329558,26,can't wait until reset tbh
560637210190151694,12,its gonna be
560637222160695297,7,a whole
560637231782690867,9,new world
560637281325809675,51,also I was trash at minecraft when the server began
560637316851564544,36,and I only got good like 3 weeks ago
560637341354426370,11,unknown yet
560637356206456852,20,probably in 2 months
560637366318923787,11,or 3 months
560637391660908555,6,who? ^
560637510762496030,9,why rcfan
560637536503070775,20,he's a funny guy imo
560637592639635469,42,also you kinda took his city away from him
560637618858229790,33,so his reaction is understandable
560637657697353731,48,plus you overpower him in every aspect as of now
560637755030503425,29,nah it was a bit further down
560637805189922826,40,but he built a wall to seperate you guys
560644253391388686,71,Kerry_ if you_ "annex" it_ it is still an illegal claim by server rules
560644277785329674,36,he built it and has the ultimate say
560644352918159360,73,the only way you'll_ "annex" it is if you make him voluntarily give it up
560644397033586698,50,which is unlikely unless you kill him or something
560644470627106846,76,which is unlikely because he'll probably refuse to fight you_ leave_ or hide
560644487710375942,15,even if he dies
560644538646003729,85,he would rather stay alive and hide than have his entire work on the server destroyed
560644650398908466,48,if you ignore that_ you will be banned for grief
560645258661068801,7,he does
560645311949701154,26,he still built them though
