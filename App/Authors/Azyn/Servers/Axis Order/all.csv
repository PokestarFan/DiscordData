560636497485758485,general,26,Thats mostly why I sold it
560636604956409856,general,61,Was sketchy af_ welded difs make you lose traction in corners
560636666130202624,general,56,Or it skips if you go slowly_ that fucks your suspension
560636769499086858,general,99,So you have to literally hit some gas to spin tires a bit to avoid messing up suspension components
560636931768188938,general,77,Match that with bald tires that cost 1.2k a set for new ones on an unsafe car
560636982229860372,general,53,I didnt drive when it rained_ had my impreza for that
560637152325664799,general,78,I just didnt want to invest in saving my dying axles and most suspension parts
560637212505538597,general,69,And actual tires and a differencial to replace the sketchy welded one
560637457561944087,general,32,Zel I gave my phone to my friend

560637959800356865,general,24,But 330ci so convertible
560638111487361037,general,16,Left is my dad's
560638253716209695,general,22,They can be money pits
560638307244048387,general,46,Might want to sell and buy one in better shape
560638449133158425,general,67,Expensive for oem parts and common failures like water pump failure
