560636497485758485,general,26,Thats mostly why I sold it
560636604956409856,general,61,Was sketchy af_ welded difs make you lose traction in corners
560636666130202624,general,56,Or it skips if you go slowly_ that fucks your suspension
560636769499086858,general,99,So you have to literally hit some gas to spin tires a bit to avoid messing up suspension components
560636931768188938,general,77,Match that with bald tires that cost 1.2k a set for new ones on an unsafe car
560636982229860372,general,53,I didnt drive when it rained_ had my impreza for that
560637152325664799,general,78,I just didnt want to invest in saving my dying axles and most suspension parts
560637212505538597,general,69,And actual tires and a differencial to replace the sketchy welded one
