560635420820635649,Axis Order,general,47,I didnt like cars before i drove my dad's 330ci
560635457600487424,Axis Order,general,36,Then i bought the next closest thing
560635496733081610,Axis Order,general,20,E46 328i was my baby
560635965862051841,Axis Order,general,17,Literal drift toy
560636044974882829,Axis Order,general,33,Didnt keep long though was sketch

560636184213061654,Axis Order,general,50,So your parents bought you a car without a license
560636195139485696,Axis Order,general,5,Yikes

560636404133265418,Axis Order,general,21,<@159672635687436290>
560636497485758485,Axis Order,general,26,Thats mostly why I sold it
560636604956409856,Axis Order,general,61,Was sketchy af_ welded difs make you lose traction in corners
560636666130202624,Axis Order,general,56,Or it skips if you go slowly_ that fucks your suspension
560636769499086858,Axis Order,general,99,So you have to literally hit some gas to spin tires a bit to avoid messing up suspension components
560636931768188938,Axis Order,general,77,Match that with bald tires that cost 1.2k a set for new ones on an unsafe car
560636982229860372,Axis Order,general,53,I didnt drive when it rained_ had my impreza for that
560637152325664799,Axis Order,general,78,I just didnt want to invest in saving my dying axles and most suspension parts
560637212505538597,Axis Order,general,69,And actual tires and a differencial to replace the sketchy welded one
560637457561944087,Axis Order,general,32,Zel I gave my phone to my friend
560637486301315083,Axis Order,general,21,Passenger was filming
560637682796068864,Axis Order,general,12,Bmw 328i E46
560637710721613851,Axis Order,general,3,'99
560637774588411910,Axis Order,general,17,E46 is generation
560637856553631744,Axis Order,general,10,What year?
560637928951513100,Axis Order,general,28,Yeah my dad has exactly that
560637959800356865,Axis Order,general,24,But 330ci so convertible
560638111487361037,Axis Order,general,16,Left is my dad's
560638253716209695,Axis Order,general,22,They can be money pits
560638307244048387,Axis Order,general,46,Might want to sell and buy one in better shape
560638449133158425,Axis Order,general,67,Expensive for oem parts and common failures like water pump failure
560638507887099921,Axis Order,general,28,Ahh nice keep it then. Enjou
560638697121382400,Axis Order,general,37,Yeah you can get fm adapters for that
560638750032658464,Axis Order,general,26,I suggested that to my dad
560639247217066002,Axis Order,general,60,You plug it in your 12 volt and select a radio channel on it
560639331530833940,Axis Order,general,82,Then you put the same channel on your radio and your phone connects to the adapter
560639449000706090,Axis Order,general,53,Don't cheap out though_ cheap ones have garbage audio
560640168650866698,Axis Order,general,19,Check reviews first
