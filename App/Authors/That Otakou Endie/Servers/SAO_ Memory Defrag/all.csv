559048878070956042,global-md,9,For party
559049164395118593,global-md,19,Oh_ just a heads up
559049373489561600,global-md,83,If you replace a water 6* with pirate asuna_ she can give you the same time reseult
559049391948955658,global-md,15,Not always_ tho
559049447112310785,global-md,42,Your other 2 units must be good as well :v
559049548375261184,global-md,24,That's the 6* one right?
559049890999697419,global-md,177,So this is just my experience_ but in the prev goddess ranking_ I used 6* Eugeo_ Asuna and Susanoo YuukiNLAfter replacing Eugeo with Pirate Asuna_ I get the same result time-wise
559049905008672769,global-md,6,Ah sad
559050067302940672,global-md,69,My best team is dark but it still takes me about 40 so ething seconds
559050168977063957,global-md,53,Ofc_ I had to use def down 4* and got down to 30s lol
559050279782449183,global-md,16,||inb4 snipers||
559050395650097192,global-md,42,More time = More snipers = Easier ranking?
559050407591149588,global-md,3,Oof
559050582225190914,global-md,66,Still_ I'm here to ask whether I should mlb pirate asuna or not :v
559050714735837214,global-md,67,Less interest for those who can do better than what I could ever do
559050986086203393,global-md,14,5k3 -> 6k1 atk
559051381550350336,global-md,88,If I really wanted to_ I can lb goddess sinon to 95 but my anniv yuuki is already at 100
559051452350332941,global-md,3,Huh
559051525436080128,global-md,43,So I guess I'll just wait for water ranking
559051554137571364,global-md,25,Probably next ranking tbh
559051753132392508,global-md,49,Earth is already on the bait banner but who knows
