560645465746440192,fortnite-general,12,Hello there.
560645629995515934,fortnite-general,35,Thirsting is a part of the game tho
560646009563119626,fortnite-general,135,I mean killing knocked players isn't for no reason. A knocked player can always be revived and can give valuable info to the enemy team
560646536157986862,fortnite-general,47,I mean isn't mods whole purpose to help anyways

560650835542016017,fortnite-general,105,I don't want to admit it_ but I am probably what most people would consider having things handed to me xD
