558805049011208202,Official Fortnite,lfg-savetheworld-pve,302,I'm needing people to help me out with the Canny Valley 6 shield defense. I'll be able to handle it with at least one (hopefully two) other people_ but I most definitely can't handle it by myself. I'm a PS4 player_ by the way_ but I can send my Epic username to anyone that needs it. Just send me a DM.
