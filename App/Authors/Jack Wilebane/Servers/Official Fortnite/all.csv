558805049011208202,lfg-savetheworld-pve,302,I'm needing people to help me out with the Canny Valley 6 shield defense. I'll be able to handle it with at least one (hopefully two) other people_ but I most definitely can't handle it by myself. I'm a PS4 player_ by the way_ but I can send my Epic username to anyone that needs it. Just send me a DM.

559051749655183362,save-the-world,170,why is it such a common occurence for objectives to bug out? there's been numerous times where the mission fails to start and i basically just wasted a bunch of materials
559051922548719647,save-the-world,41,that seems like a really bad way to do it
