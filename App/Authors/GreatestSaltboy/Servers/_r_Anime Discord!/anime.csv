558757858838183937,24,damn rev why you do this
558758627134144523,81,maybe apo before go too because it has characters from there play important roles
558759349342961676,58,you don't have any choice with fate route outside VN sadly
558759480611962882,51,deen *kinda* attempts to be a fate route adaptation
558759621842698240,52,but it changes to try concepts from other routes too
558759699068092426,39,yeah but that's jumpy and not enjoyable
558759961790906379,24,it's much better with it
558760137502752768,69,some things from ubw you'll just miss without context from fate route

558761540849762309,36,I just want to watch oath under snow
558761582276902912,54,but people telling me I need the prior 3 seasons first
558761812259110922,44,so it'll be quite the work until I get to it
558761916261203970,66,nah I want my stuff to make sense <:GWqlabsKek:393085130219978752>

558769881537839114,8,tag that
558770385894768670,106,it's the closure to stay night_ granted I'm soon to read its actual contents but it is supposed to be that
558770624475037728,23,isn't ha mostly comedic
