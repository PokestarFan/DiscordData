558806484339654676,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,160,_looks_ well not like there's a lot to review_ of what's there_ imo it looks fine_ everything is nicely separated into little sections of related function calls
558808067555459076,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,84,this is probably bad practice_ but i'd import `import javafx.scene.shape.*;` instead
558809177779208192,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,14,don't think so
558809369706496013,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,43,so it wouldn't import `javafx.scene.*;` etc
558810088693956635,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,26,nah it's got a good reason
558810159472967682,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,91,firstly everything would be super slow if you imported hundreds if not thousands of classes
558810268403105815,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,75,secondly you probably didn't want anything from the child namespaces anyway
558810361478774784,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,128,it might be a thing you want in a scripting language_ but definitely not java (btw_ scripting languages don't allow this either)
558811822719762452,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,35,<@314205761846902788> what language
558814525076275200,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,3,uhm
558814601651683369,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,55,assignment expressions were introduced in python in 3.8
558814649332662279,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,52,in Java 1 doesn't work as true <@314205761846902788>
558814716537864202,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,51,in python_ yes. in Java_ it's not a `boolean` so no
558851663041921035,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,2,ew
558851694969094144,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,6,python
558851715261005824,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,12,is third wtf
558851866746945536,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,117,i think python is misrepresented (and to an extent JS too) because they're usually the only language respondents know
558851885835091998,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,37,so they have nothing to compare it to
558852088206065664,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,76,well_ not that people know more than one language for other languages though
558852211132596234,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,85,but i guess it's that they have a bit of an advantage from being scripting languages?
558852400274997276,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,29,also ðŸ¤” rust is hard to learn?
558852913628446721,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,24,ðŸ˜¦ aww we can't ping mods
558852984042422272,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,56,re: "what languages and tools they are comfortable with"
558853030074646550,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,62,would there need to be guidelines on what counts/doesn't count
558853458879315974,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,39,depending on the meaning of larger_ yes
558853511920484394,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,49,i haven't done larger as in multiple people large
558853627087683594,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,3,lol
558854101497020437,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,115,re: python. sure_ it isn't _bad_. but no way is it _that_ much better than literally every other scripting language
558855431162953748,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,17,ðŸ¤” hmm. fair point
559030458248200214,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,130,Really the main advantage Photoshop offers over other tools is Custom brushes and the like_ and AI(?)-based tools like the bandaid
559031304314945536,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,76,Hmm. I guess not custom brushes. A more flexible image format then_ possibly
559031445469921300,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,61,Or maybe they've just taken up the entire market from day one
559031466609213450,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,7,Like M$
559031885225918485,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,21,Thanks has blue eyes?
559031894012854287,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,2,Oh
559031949767868447,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,15,Autocorrect pls
559032257017544736,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,117,<@315812499872022530> well PS definitely also has an edge over its competitors_ I'm just not sure how much of an edge
559032459371741216,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,79,I guess it's just good for photo manipulation like it was probably intended for
