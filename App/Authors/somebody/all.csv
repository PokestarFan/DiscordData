558806484339654676,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,160,_looks_ well not like there's a lot to review_ of what's there_ imo it looks fine_ everything is nicely separated into little sections of related function calls
558808067555459076,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,84,this is probably bad practice_ but i'd import `import javafx.scene.shape.*;` instead
558809177779208192,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,14,don't think so
558809369706496013,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,43,so it wouldn't import `javafx.scene.*;` etc
558810088693956635,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,26,nah it's got a good reason
558810159472967682,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,91,firstly everything would be super slow if you imported hundreds if not thousands of classes
558810268403105815,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,75,secondly you probably didn't want anything from the child namespaces anyway
558810361478774784,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,128,it might be a thing you want in a scripting language_ but definitely not java (btw_ scripting languages don't allow this either)
558811822719762452,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,35,<@314205761846902788> what language
558814525076275200,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,3,uhm
558814601651683369,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,55,assignment expressions were introduced in python in 3.8
558814649332662279,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,52,in Java 1 doesn't work as true <@314205761846902788>
558814716537864202,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,51,in python_ yes. in Java_ it's not a `boolean` so no
558851663041921035,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,2,ew
558851694969094144,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,6,python
558851715261005824,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,12,is third wtf
558851866746945536,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,117,i think python is misrepresented (and to an extent JS too) because they're usually the only language respondents know
558851885835091998,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,37,so they have nothing to compare it to
558852088206065664,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,76,well_ not that people know more than one language for other languages though
558852211132596234,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,85,but i guess it's that they have a bit of an advantage from being scripting languages?
558852400274997276,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,29,also ü§î rust is hard to learn?
558852913628446721,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,24,üò¶ aww we can't ping mods
558852984042422272,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,56,re: "what languages and tools they are comfortable with"
558853030074646550,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,62,would there need to be guidelines on what counts/doesn't count
558853458879315974,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,39,depending on the meaning of larger_ yes
558853511920484394,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,49,i haven't done larger as in multiple people large
558853627087683594,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,3,lol
558854101497020437,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,115,re: python. sure_ it isn't _bad_. but no way is it _that_ much better than literally every other scripting language
558855431162953748,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,17,ü§î hmm. fair point
559030458248200214,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,130,Really the main advantage Photoshop offers over other tools is Custom brushes and the like_ and AI(?)-based tools like the bandaid
559031304314945536,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,76,Hmm. I guess not custom brushes. A more flexible image format then_ possibly
559031445469921300,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,61,Or maybe they've just taken up the entire market from day one
559031466609213450,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,7,Like M$
559031885225918485,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,21,Thanks has blue eyes?
559031894012854287,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,2,Oh
559031949767868447,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,15,Autocorrect pls
559032257017544736,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,117,<@315812499872022530> well PS definitely also has an edge over its competitors_ I'm just not sure how much of an edge
559032459371741216,/r/ProgrammerHumor,off-topic,79,I guess it's just good for photo manipulation like it was probably intended for
560285398161424386,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,104,> The compiler will produce warnings for basically everything_ and assigning in if statements is illegal
560285439685033996,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,26,a lot of languages do this
560285483783946258,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,39,> assigning in if statements is illegal
560285595813937153,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,1,üò¶
560285598129193001,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,2,ok
560286183196852235,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,83,ü§î hmm. does this count as criticism? i'm just pointing out that these exist already
560286770126782474,/r/ProgrammerHumor,general-discussions,57,anyway... yeah <@!345639698678677508> mind explaining #3?
560621397781643274,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,92,<@194861788926443520> not the best for working across multiple devices - cloud9 is a thing üòõ
560621511812317215,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,59,<@205069548595052544> i started a kinda large project at 16
560627417832488960,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,66,<@326422614073671681> why would the parser care about the contents
560627597294174219,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,132,if you mean the lexer outputting `BINARY_LITERAL` instead of the parser figuring which one it is then that's done very_ _very_ often
560628209029349396,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,3,uhh
560628235445207086,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,40,isn't that the conventional way to do it
560628325261901824,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,39,well some people use subclass of `Node`
560628378672300033,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,26,<@326422614073671681> hmm?
560628537028116481,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,56,<@242066553183404032> it pays off right from the start üòõ
560628709594497025,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,4,hmm?
560628864800260098,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,53,yeah normally you'd just have a terminal for `NUMBER`
560628898304491521,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,38,the parser does _not_ need to know how
560629175355179038,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,108,then wdym "The parser would care if it were looking to make sure that the token matched the production rule"
560629211027734528,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,1,üòê
560629481702686721,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,183,```NLnumber = BINARY_LITERAL {% Token(BINARY_LITERAL_ item) %}NL  | HEXADECIMAL_LITERAL {% Token(HEXADECIMAL_LITERAL_ item) %}NL  | DECIMAL_LITERAL {% Token(DECIMAL_LITERAL_ item) %}NL```
560629651391905843,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,69,"I tokenized all of the digits in a number." - together or separately
560629791053840384,/r/ProgrammerHumor,programming,142,what i'm saying is the parser _doesn't need to know_ what the lexer does. it's a lot easier if you just assume the lexer is behaving correctly
