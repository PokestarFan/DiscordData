558851694969094144,6,python
558851715261005824,12,is third wtf
558851866746945536,117,i think python is misrepresented (and to an extent JS too) because they're usually the only language respondents know
558851885835091998,37,so they have nothing to compare it to
558852088206065664,76,well_ not that people know more than one language for other languages though

558853458879315974,39,depending on the meaning of larger_ yes
558853511920484394,49,i haven't done larger as in multiple people large
558853627087683594,3,lol
558854101497020437,115,re: python. sure_ it isn't _bad_. but no way is it _that_ much better than literally every other scripting language
558855431162953748,17,ðŸ¤” hmm. fair point
