558806484339654676,general-discussions,160,_looks_ well not like there's a lot to review_ of what's there_ imo it looks fine_ everything is nicely separated into little sections of related function calls
558808067555459076,general-discussions,84,this is probably bad practice_ but i'd import `import javafx.scene.shape.*;` instead
558809177779208192,general-discussions,14,don't think so
558809369706496013,general-discussions,43,so it wouldn't import `javafx.scene.*;` etc
558810088693956635,general-discussions,26,nah it's got a good reason
558810159472967682,general-discussions,91,firstly everything would be super slow if you imported hundreds if not thousands of classes
558810268403105815,general-discussions,75,secondly you probably didn't want anything from the child namespaces anyway
558810361478774784,general-discussions,128,it might be a thing you want in a scripting language_ but definitely not java (btw_ scripting languages don't allow this either)
558811822719762452,programming,35,<@314205761846902788> what language
558814525076275200,programming,3,uhm
558814601651683369,programming,55,assignment expressions were introduced in python in 3.8
558814649332662279,programming,52,in Java 1 doesn't work as true <@314205761846902788>
558814716537864202,programming,51,in python_ yes. in Java_ it's not a `boolean` so no
558851663041921035,programming,2,ew
558851694969094144,programming,6,python
558851715261005824,programming,12,is third wtf
558851866746945536,programming,117,i think python is misrepresented (and to an extent JS too) because they're usually the only language respondents know
558851885835091998,programming,37,so they have nothing to compare it to
558852088206065664,programming,76,well_ not that people know more than one language for other languages though
558852211132596234,programming,85,but i guess it's that they have a bit of an advantage from being scripting languages?
558852400274997276,programming,29,also 🤔 rust is hard to learn?
558852913628446721,programming,24,😦 aww we can't ping mods
558852984042422272,programming,56,re: "what languages and tools they are comfortable with"
558853030074646550,programming,62,would there need to be guidelines on what counts/doesn't count
558853458879315974,programming,39,depending on the meaning of larger_ yes
558853511920484394,programming,49,i haven't done larger as in multiple people large
558853627087683594,programming,3,lol
558854101497020437,programming,115,re: python. sure_ it isn't _bad_. but no way is it _that_ much better than literally every other scripting language
558855431162953748,programming,17,🤔 hmm. fair point
559030458248200214,off-topic,130,Really the main advantage Photoshop offers over other tools is Custom brushes and the like_ and AI(?)-based tools like the bandaid
559031304314945536,off-topic,76,Hmm. I guess not custom brushes. A more flexible image format then_ possibly
559031445469921300,off-topic,61,Or maybe they've just taken up the entire market from day one
559031466609213450,off-topic,7,Like M$
559031885225918485,off-topic,21,Thanks has blue eyes?
559031894012854287,off-topic,2,Oh
559031949767868447,off-topic,15,Autocorrect pls
559032257017544736,off-topic,117,<@315812499872022530> well PS definitely also has an edge over its competitors_ I'm just not sure how much of an edge
559032459371741216,off-topic,79,I guess it's just good for photo manipulation like it was probably intended for
560285398161424386,general-discussions,104,> The compiler will produce warnings for basically everything_ and assigning in if statements is illegal
560285439685033996,general-discussions,26,a lot of languages do this
560285483783946258,general-discussions,39,> assigning in if statements is illegal
560285595813937153,general-discussions,1,😦
560285598129193001,general-discussions,2,ok
560286183196852235,general-discussions,83,🤔 hmm. does this count as criticism? i'm just pointing out that these exist already
560286770126782474,general-discussions,57,anyway... yeah <@!345639698678677508> mind explaining #3?
560621397781643274,programming,92,<@194861788926443520> not the best for working across multiple devices - cloud9 is a thing 😛
560621511812317215,programming,59,<@205069548595052544> i started a kinda large project at 16
