558806484339654676,160,_looks_ well not like there's a lot to review_ of what's there_ imo it looks fine_ everything is nicely separated into little sections of related function calls
558808067555459076,84,this is probably bad practice_ but i'd import `import javafx.scene.shape.*;` instead
558809177779208192,14,don't think so
558809369706496013,43,so it wouldn't import `javafx.scene.*;` etc
558810088693956635,26,nah it's got a good reason
558810159472967682,91,firstly everything would be super slow if you imported hundreds if not thousands of classes
558810268403105815,75,secondly you probably didn't want anything from the child namespaces anyway
558810361478774784,128,it might be a thing you want in a scripting language_ but definitely not java (btw_ scripting languages don't allow this either)
