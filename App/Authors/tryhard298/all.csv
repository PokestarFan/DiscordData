558856985194266628,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,370,<@203408998618234881> can we have a actual talk? I never even knew the guy who tweeted that. As I said_ I don’t even have Twitter. I don’t see why I’m getting banned for something I have nothing to do with. Please actually have a professional talk instead of just completely banning me from everything. Stop acting so childish_ and please lets just have a talk about it.
