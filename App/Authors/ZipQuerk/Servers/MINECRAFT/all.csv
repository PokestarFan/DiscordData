558447490681012225,minecraft,62,So I talked to jeb about shields requiring a crouch in bedrock
558447657614573588,minecraft,61,He said they will probably tweak them to not require a crouch
558447866364952587,minecraft,109,<@204259045840781312> Because PE needs to crouch to use them and they want it to be fair across all platforms
558448020392378369,minecraft,126,I did suggest a separate button for shields to jeb_ and he said that they will probably tweak it in the future_ so no worries.
558448076415828063,minecraft,29,As in a separate button on PE

560629018534215680,minecraft,29,How the fuck is it """bad""""
560629212831285248,minecraft,131,Right_ but it can be very good alongside a bow for farther targets and better damage_ multishot and charge holding are hella useful
560629300546633748,minecraft,49,Just carry one around it's really good long range

560631003417411634,minecraft,537,With a nice enchanted crossbow Vs a nice enchanted bow_ we haveNLNLBow doing slightly more damage_ ability to fire aspect_ and PunchNLNLCrossbow getting longer range_ multishot_ slightly less damage but more bullet velocity_ charge holding and the likes.NLNLWhen it comes down to it I'd say an unenchanted bow is better than an unenchanted crossbow but when enchanted the crossbow takes the cake. Both can be swapped out with eachother_ for example in the Wither you probably want Multishot_ But bringing both with you isn't a bad idea either.
560631196313452555,minecraft,39,Yeah but it doesn't have any use really
560631247349612554,minecraft,19,More of a fun thing
