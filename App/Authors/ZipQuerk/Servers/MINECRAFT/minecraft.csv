558447490681012225,62,So I talked to jeb about shields requiring a crouch in bedrock
558447657614573588,61,He said they will probably tweak them to not require a crouch
558447866364952587,109,<@204259045840781312> Because PE needs to crouch to use them and they want it to be fair across all platforms
558448020392378369,126,I did suggest a separate button for shields to jeb_ and he said that they will probably tweak it in the future_ so no worries.
558448076415828063,29,As in a separate button on PE
