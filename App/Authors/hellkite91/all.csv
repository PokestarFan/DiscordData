558441740453806081,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,1052,Sup_ had a question bout buying the I want to eat your Pancreas anime film Blu Ray that's coming out soon. If this isn't the right channel_ lemme know where I should be posting. Thanks.NLNLhttps://kimisui-anime.com/bddvd/NLNL1. What's the preferred proxy buying service for getting preorders from TSUTAYA online? I like their limited edition goodies the best_ but dont know which service is ideal. shipping will be to USA.NLNL2. looking for a sanity check_ cuz im relying on google translate. The common book cover and clear bookmark set is just for the plain limited edition or has to be from that fancy exclusive limited edition that some stores are offering? I looked at the amazon.jp listings for both the regular limited edition and their exclusive limited edition. Only the exclusive one mentions the book cover set in the title and has a pic of it. But neither of them explicitly list that piece of merchandise in the product content description. I'd link the page for each item_ but the urls are hella long and idk if link shorteners are allowed here
558442002031575051,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,128,damn u read fast. i want the goodies. and considering there's no annoucnement date yet even for the NA one_ i wanna buy this now
558446303219154965,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,252,ok ignore the question bout the book cover set. just reread the description on the anime website_ and it's only the amazon exclusive limited version that gets it. still looking for help on finding a proxy service website to preorder from TSUTAYA online
558447148082135050,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,79,ive never used a proxy service before so im honestly really clueless about this
558447526861340674,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,102,amazon.jp is no problem_ the item offers shipping straight to US. I just like tsutaya's goodies better
558448132766040078,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,199,how much should i expect to pay for all the shipping and middleman fees. you wouldn't happen to know? i do like the goodies_ but not if it's gonna cost like way more than getting straight from amazon
558448351008260117,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,27,ok i can handle another $30
558449042821087233,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,92,u had to pay for both shipping the item to zen market and then them shipping it to u_ right?
558449202712018975,/r/Anime Discord!,merch,13,u live in US?
