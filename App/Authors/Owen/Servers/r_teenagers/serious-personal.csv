558762752093585409,16,God fucking damn
558762798889566229,65,I feel bad for accepting that $100 in the card my stepdad gave me
558762860994363430,108,Already got a lot going on_ the last thing he should worry about is giving me money even if it's my birthday
558763010412511273,137,I hope he finds a better job cause his current job he is still in that routine of texting my mom but she's gone forever so that's no good
558763708545761290,24,Yeah that's good I guess
558769199997255696,323,I've had feelings for this girl in my grade and I used to be her streaks often but now she just takes scenery streaks. Anyway since today is my birthday she had our Spanish class sing Happy birthday and she drew "Feliz Cumplea√±os Ernesto (my fake name for Spanish class)!" And she did her Spanish project on my birthday lol
558769221748916235,28,Not sure if she has feelings
558769381996363787,121,She's single atm but sometimes she seems like she's not all that interested and I can't tell if she's playing hard to get
558769520916037633,32,I might ask her to hang out yeah
558769588955906058,5,Right
558769633608597524,6,I know
558777699259252738,83,Nothing you can do but accept all the shit life gives you and grow stronger from it
558777932613550089,37,It's a skill to work on with everyone
558778104965758996,73,My father is a Burger King positional manager_ not sure how much he makes
558778131096535050,28,I don't live with him though
558778214340624384,27,Yeah but positional manager
558778258594725924,42,Burger King is like a lifelong job for him
558778535767179285,77,I'm pretty damn sure he makes more than that <:hyperthonk:556454097574952990>
558778614103932928,35,Maybe I'm wrong on what he works as
558778899471794186,198,Anyway the government wants him paying child support towards my grandmother like he did with my mother because my grandmother is getting my siblings and my survivor benefits from my mother's passing
558778950260752385,15,pretty bullshit
558779181589331969,88,Like I said only thing you can do is take the hits from life and get stronger and better
558779419695644673,71,I have 0 hours of my day where I feel like I'm not being fucked by life
558779427354312724,18,you get used to it
558779656657043457,4,5'3"
558779806796218371,32,I've got pretty bad height genes
558779995590492172,43,Cool thanks for the opinion mr internet man
558780171092492301,52,Last time I had a bday party I was what 11 years old
558780430862647296,79,Yeah my family has never been more than low-middle class <@!462970486905896961>
558780450093400065,38,Sorry if that sounds unfamiliar to you
558780669589979166,75,I'm gonna at least make sure my children get a better childhood than I have
558780707443310622,59,But still gonna have to teach them the lessons I've learned
558780850934644746,19,Glad I can't relate
558780866202173440,30,I'm sorry about your situation
558781052710158356,4,Damn
558781122700378142,143,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468397348184260608/558608209078910987/IMG_20190319_080726_921.jpgNLPic of my mother and I from circa 2015
558781142237446184,17,Simpler times man
558781201901420548,46,I know if there's another side she's just fine
558781307857928212,34,Well I actually can't relate there
558781433704087552,67,My mom was in a shock program when I was in either 3rd or 5th grade
558781440880410654,14,Can't remember
558781502167580674,89,it was for 6 months and I was on the verge of being taken into custody of any of my aunts
558781609319333909,104,Thankfully my grandmother fought for the custody and won and I could still live with my mother afterward
558781635638853632,52,God I will never forget the last time I ever saw her
558781685567848460,36,Laying in her bed_ delirious_ sickly
558781726256529422,37,Shit like this changes a man_ ya know
558785004948291624,44,That doesn't mean they don't love you dearly
558785356963512360,214,No_ I'm not kidding you. My grandmother is the same way. People get stressed_ and they take that negative energy out on others either without thinking about it or merely to get the negative energy tension released.
558785685901934592,50,Well first option on the table is stress obviously
558785879561207810,45,Then why don't you initiate the conversation?
558786485508374557,394,I think I do get it. My mother was like that a lot. She lived in the same house yet she would only ever look at me and never initiate conversation_ she'd stay sedentary in her room for days on end and I would see her maybe once a week. It was 10 days between when I saw her on Christmas and the last day I'd ever get to see my mother before she died. My only regret is not communicating enough.
558786737867063296,15,We're all lost.
558786895585476608,33,Yeah_ life gives us all a beating
558787092126236673,106,Everything happens for a reason. I guess you had to become stronger from those situations for some reason.
558787293930848260,69,And through that you train your discipline like a muscle and it grows
558787512647286819,68,In my entire 15 years I don't remember a single day of it being easy
558787816239136769,39,You are what you make of your situation
558788881588289546,289,Well_ instead of getting my act together and getting a headstart on living without the shoulders of a parent to cry or lie on at age 15_ I could've turned to drugs [I was also abusing drugs in August 2018] or I could've just stopped caring in general and let myself fall into a depression.
558789063235338262,61,That is good but there are other negative ways to handle life
558789210014744576,59,Are you going to wait_ or are you going to take initiative?
558789267636224000,64,I can promise you if you choose to wait it will 99% never happen
558789428072415233,52,Yelling back at your father is not taking initiative
558789573434408960,57,Who's saying it's not bad when he talks shit to you guys?
558790152798076928,92,You can choose to have that mindset_ or you can choose a better mindset and outlook on life.
558790192274604033,56,I can't tell you how to look at life_ I do not know you.
558790438564134927,25,Why do you say you can't?
558790555618770945,67,If you are unwilling to improve_ that's where this discussion ends.
558790922201202698,59,List at least 5 ways you have attempted to improve yourself
558790939540324412,33,This can be improvements anywhere
558790960914628619,29,skills_ mindset_ habits_ etc.
558831545645793281,33,Well moreso the kidneys I believe
