558831611169472534,825,So there's this girl in my grade_ I'm pretty confident she's got feelings for me. A quote of mine is her finsta bio if that means anything. Before she just started sending generic streaks she and I would be her streaks often. Today for my birthday she tried to get the our Spanish class to sing Happy birthday_ she wrote "Feliz Cumplea√±os Ernesto (my fake name for Spanish class)!" With a cool design and she based the Spanish project we were working on at the time on my birthday party. She was the only person to actually have a birthday spam for me (I had many people post hbd to me but each just one pic) and she seems to trust me (she has told me some personal stuff that might sound pretty nasty so I won't say it unless asked). She is single as well_ but she recently rejected another guy_ even though he was a senior.
