558440600467406851,r/teenagers,debates,75,also_ the euro kind of fucked over italy_ greece_ spain_ ireland & portugal

558441428716617728,r/teenagers,debates,84,and now they tried it again under the guise of a political confederation & succeeded
558441568034357248,r/teenagers,debates,105,<@157182982120144897> germany tried to take europe but failed because of coordinated resistance **TWICE**
558441640658862111,r/teenagers,debates,43,But yeah_ germany is too powerful in the EU

558442991644180482,r/teenagers,debates,61,Not to mention the japanese troops still fighting across Asia

558443678046224404,r/teenagers,debates,22,It sure as hell didn't
558443784204189707,r/teenagers,debates,95,Russia rebelled & will continue to be an independent nation so long as russian identity remains
558443875036037150,r/teenagers,debates,82,It's how russia survived invasikns by mongolia_ poland_ sweden_ france & the nazis
558443914990845962,r/teenagers,debates,11,Nationalism
558444171950686208,r/teenagers,debates,112,Russia would have lost had they not thrown every civilian in the way of the nazi army so they could slow it down

558445056927727647,r/teenagers,debates,41,it took them 2 years to finally stop them
558445111122329630,r/teenagers,debates,30,And 4 years to March on berlin
558445217875886093,r/teenagers,debates,27,Yeah I'm not disputing that

558446100877541376,r/teenagers,debates,36,Even after the country was liberated
558446231945347092,r/teenagers,debates,87,<@157182982120144897> the charlemagne division was already pretty useless to begin with
558446449675730955,r/teenagers,debates,90,After 1943 the SS scrambled to assemble new divisions_ right when german defeat was sealed
558446469841944576,r/teenagers,debates,18,Color me surprised

558446797505167412,r/teenagers,debates,57,Hitler had a dog that he killed before the end of the war
558446828480364561,r/teenagers,debates,16,RIP blondi :cey:
558447018528210944,r/teenagers,debates,96,tbh I'm surprised there were no rebellions by commies or jews in response to Hitler's ascendancy
558447103337168906,r/teenagers,debates,58,<@157182982120144897> none big enough to make a difference
558447159834443776,r/teenagers,debates,42,<@275056508666904576> that was late in ww2

558447547807432710,r/teenagers,debates,148,Honestly I'm surprised no major rebellions happen after a Democrat is elected_ given how the people who despise them the most are armed to the teeth
558447651708862465,r/teenagers,debates,11,Makes sense
558447749323030531,r/teenagers,debates,47,Some of them do & end up with 20 year sentences
558447766221881353,r/teenagers,debates,26,<@547988332135710751> what

558448059470577664,r/teenagers,debates,38,I lean right & support the environment
558448223564333056,r/teenagers,debates,141,but imo all you need is offer the big corporations tax breaks for taking care of the environment & they'll fucking save the world in a decade
558448262353518624,r/teenagers,debates,41,if the tax breaks are big enough_ that is
558448438182674433,r/teenagers,debates,55,It's regulation under a new name_ think of it like that
558448484202840064,r/teenagers,debates,59,<@157182982120144897> then lets make them fucking earn them
558448554100654080,r/teenagers,debates,52,<@148507515888336897> we're doing that right now lol
558448648942387230,r/teenagers,debates,61,<@157182982120144897> have you ever left your basement before
558448674976432139,r/teenagers,debates,34,that is the opposite of solving it
558448737467498516,r/teenagers,debates,65,it's giving more fuel to people who fuckin hate environmentalists
558448960340099098,r/teenagers,debates,8,but yeah
558449068397953025,r/teenagers,debates,75,just suspend tax breaks for companies unless they agree to lessen emissions
558449101587480576,r/teenagers,debates,21,does that make sense?
558449244822831133,r/teenagers,debates,65,regulation workw_ but too much of it will turn them the wrong way
558449293527089163,r/teenagers,debates,10,thanks lol
558449356701958155,r/teenagers,debates,22,the opposite direction
558449362477383690,r/teenagers,debates,5,as in
558449375047843871,r/teenagers,debates,18,Outside of the usa
558449413383782400,r/teenagers,debates,44,they'll move to a place with less regulation
558449639859290113,r/teenagers,debates,69,<@157182982120144897> that doesn't work_ it only harms your own image
558449717332148274,r/teenagers,debates,30,the image of environmentalists
558449821019799555,r/teenagers,debates,100,stop personally attacking the ceos_ they are just figureheads at this point & can be easily replaced
558449849599524874,r/teenagers,debates,32,<@157182982120144897> i can tell
558449894357204993,r/teenagers,debates,48,but focus on the corporations themselves instead
558449977496698890,r/teenagers,debates,57,<@157182982120144897> elaborate on what you mean "attack"
558450034690228241,r/teenagers,debates,22,that's even more vague
558450093703954442,r/teenagers,debates,47,do you plan on using physical violence on them?
558450209139589130,r/teenagers,debates,57,Have you been paying attention to a word I've been saying
558450269982294027,r/teenagers,debates,16,Genuine question
558450524320694302,r/teenagers,debates,80,You're advocating attacking people solely for involvement with certain companies
558450570893983745,r/teenagers,debates,48,rather than hitting the company where it matters
558450651370225667,r/teenagers,debates,39,do you never think what you say through
558451129449447425,r/teenagers,debates,61,attacking people isn't helping it_ you do realize this right?
558451255677026314,r/teenagers,debates,60,Giving a jail sentence to them isn't stopping climate change
558451275855822848,r/teenagers,debates,9,go for it
558451551350423572,r/teenagers,debates,17,define capitalism
558451718707216404,r/teenagers,debates,2,ok
558451746813247510,r/teenagers,debates,31,This actually sounds decent but
558451765763244042,r/teenagers,debates,27,What system will replace it
558451806192009219,r/teenagers,debates,35,That is the million dollar question
558456551652982803,r/teenagers,debates,11,Ok I'm back
558456693634105347,r/teenagers,debates,7,Anyways
558456746667016222,r/teenagers,debates,41,So how will socialism cure climate change
558456864812040213,r/teenagers,debates,61,shit man why didn't i think avout that  <@209038403621224449>
558456946999689236,r/teenagers,debates,20,i was talking to mop
558457040381411348,r/teenagers,debates,102,he seems to think that having a socialist society where workers are in charge will stop climate change
558457077689876501,r/teenagers,debates,21,<@157182982120144897>
558457432494309397,r/teenagers,debates,9,nice name
558457979116978177,r/teenagers,debates,96,i skimmed through it to understand a basic point & still can't figure out how socialism fixes it
558458023060832256,r/teenagers,debates,14,what the frick
558458512230055945,r/teenagers,debates,36,Ok so i finished reading the article
558458547738771479,r/teenagers,debates,43,and i understand their reasoning better now
558458575458926603,r/teenagers,debates,30,but the argument is still shit
558458696040972299,r/teenagers,debates,28,<@481585290176233482> agreed
558458764252938253,r/teenagers,debates,23,a fucking opinion piece
558458787032203274,r/teenagers,debates,6,really
558459321386532864,r/teenagers,debates,17,Ok i just read it

558765567448973312,r/teenagers,debates,87,<@292768138859380748> there is the coast guard & a civilian equivalent of the air force

558765866200858624,r/teenagers,debates,77,what I'm saying is that immigration to the us is more than getting on us soil

558765993728671776,r/teenagers,debates,57,where we accept people with skills from wartorn countries

558766987296374785,r/teenagers,debates,134,people choose stability over democracy in russia because when they did have democracy their country was on fire for more than a decade
558767087875784716,r/teenagers,debates,39,how is free speech going away in the us
558767155647217665,r/teenagers,debates,65,trump talking shit about cnn isn't proof of government censorship

558767381174943747,r/teenagers,debates,16,much like turkey

558768014418509844,r/teenagers,debates,57,Iran is a bit odd_ i know i made a surface level analysis
558768058848509959,r/teenagers,debates,35,it has like 20 different minorities
558768093942513666,r/teenagers,debates,35,And a lot of them want independence
558768207159099392,r/teenagers,debates,35,The most notable ones are the kurds
558768246791077923,r/teenagers,debates,36,azeris want to unite with Azerbaijan
558768310880174080,r/teenagers,debates,58,balochis in pakistan & iran want to make their own country

558768641638662174,r/teenagers,debates,29,But kurds definitely want out
558768775336296468,r/teenagers,debates,105,their population in all 4 countries have tried leaving multiple times from their aforementioned countries
558768796052094978,r/teenagers,debates,27,and making their own states
558768883876626463,r/teenagers,debates,71,And balochi separatism is an issue in pakistan_ but idk much about iran

558770680875843602,r/teenagers,debates,1,^
558770816691601409,r/teenagers,debates,126,the reason the entire 3rd world wants to move to europe/usa is because of a lack of water_ caused by global warming indirectly
558770910690017320,r/teenagers,debates,53,Not because "immigrants want to destroy your country"
558772572972646429,r/teenagers,debates,20,Sleepy chat hours :(

558795611684470815,r/teenagers,debates,32,You can if you restrain yourself
558795855662940192,r/teenagers,debates,69,Why can't we go back to the days when premarital sex was rare as fuck

559041048089985036,r/teenagers,debates,525,My point is that any country needs to have a single united population. If a bunch of polish people moved to germany & refused to learn german_ they would suffer & their standards of living compared to the native population would be lower due to their lesser opportunities. In this scenario_ it is important to assimilate these polish people so that they can have the same equal opportunities as germans by_ at the very least_ forcing the language upon them so that they can communicate with the dominant group in the country.
