560963116364464151,debates,53,gender studies? of course you can get a job with that
560963227916304385,debates,56,Well_ researcher about gender or sociologist for a start

560965276548726815,debates,68,we can still have infighting after the threat from the right is gone
560965313408270346,debates,79,<@!324626144664223744> we literally want to expand your rights and well being ðŸ˜¿

560975439460302861,debates,14,Please tell me
560975956676968450,debates,0,
560976074205298748,debates,44,what the fuck kind of wizardry math is that?
560976085639233546,debates,8,no no no
560976096385040385,debates,31,you dont get to make up numbers
560976176995237908,debates,12,Yes_ exactly
560976194061991936,debates,44,you need to change the system if its failing
560976372873429013,debates,49,the US gdp is about 150 times that of finland btw
560976426275438592,debates,42,but their population is only 60 times more
560976468524400640,debates,49,how come they spend similar % on healthcare then?
560976491211653131,debates,39,could it be the US system sucks? No way
560976658161598467,debates,131,supply and demand? Like the insulin prices of 800$? We should not fuck with that? Insulin costs scraps everywhere else in the world
560976704429096960,debates,76,If you dont intervene_ big pharma just squeezes every penny out of customers
560976757298167828,debates,101,Not to mention that they might not even cure customers since yknow_ that would be a loss for business
560976876655345674,debates,37,yeah exactly. start fixing the system
560976901112463378,debates,22,thats what I want_ yes
560976992128991233,debates,74,well the healthcare is fixable by fixing the system with current money yes
560977073259151375,debates,70,more taxes would help expand infrastructure for many thigns fastert ho
560977176007278624,debates,65,I want public healthcare for everyone_ and private to be optional
560977221192384541,debates,31,I'd say its doable in 3-4 years
560977245087334402,debates,33,If they would start reforms today
560977290486349826,debates,64,Why should the rich get better healthcare <@!226566343456063489>
560977345327005707,debates,32,Are the poor less worthy of life
560977431373021186,debates,3,Why
560977461161230336,debates,32,I can see faster_ but why better
560977498372964362,debates,70,Its not actually_ public system is faster than private here oftentimes
560977575694827548,debates,42,<@!411880149273935872> Theyre not starving
560977604765810728,debates,37,theyre dying from 800$ insulin prices
560977642476666905,debates,38,which one is more inhumane? You ask me
560977710818525185,debates,40,Yes thats what Im yelling for 1 hour now
560977793651965990,debates,85,If you had programs for that_ gofundme wouldnt account for 1/3 of healthcare expenses
560977896311750666,debates,62,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170125145848.htm
560978411292721154,debates,37,this one is just deaths from diabetes
560978988067979284,debates,33,americans are a bit different tbh
560979006837751818,debates,38,french people riot over a new fuel tax
560979034486341653,debates,51,americans sit out everything without batting an eye
560979066551926804,debates,32,chatteled to capitalism_ its sad
560979111799947269,debates,30,the poor are indeed pissed tho
560979159187193886,debates,93,<@!266048997381242890> Oh_ the french gov gave permission to open fire with live ammo on them
560979179563384835,debates,31,I cant wait for the guillotines
560979224706547713,debates,36,In case it escalates i shoud mention
560979248068820993,debates,29,not if they just stand around
560979302456360980,debates,99,but they torched a market recently and after that the police was given shoot orders "if threatened"
560979652965957643,debates,66,ok found some stats_ germany has ~1300 death annualy from diabetes
560979670884155402,debates,16,the us has 69000
560979690727276554,debates,33,germany has 1/4 of the population
560979714173566986,debates,52,Its safe to assume somethings wrong here I would say
560979822759772162,debates,59,yeah thats the problem_ that its so open to interpretation.
560979868968419328,debates,74,they killed 2 people up until now_ but that was blunt force_ not live ammo
560979900111257601,debates,38,I hope they dont actually shoot anyone
560979928854822912,debates,69,but if they do I hope the french torch the entire government to ashes
560979955559825418,debates,35,I admire their revolutionary spirit
560980220505620490,debates,95,they are literally fighting against the president raising taxes and eliminating social security
560980282811875359,debates,37,the left always looks bad in the west
560980289669693450,debates,13,its by design
560980447127928843,debates,84,well shit I want it to go as peaceful as possible but I wont stop anyone from revvin
560980495790374941,debates,38,at least its better than doing nothing
560981896176336898,debates,211,btw I found an NPR article on insulin if youre still interested <@!411880149273935872> NLhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/01/641615877/insulins-high-cost-leads-to-lethal-rationing?t=1553818115066
560981947271086090,debates,75,<@!324626144664223744> Maybe. Thats what the guys in weimar thought im sure
560982011637006336,debates,77,And not making any implications about trump but he gave the alt right a voice
560982063789113355,debates,60,Not intentionally really_ I dont think hes alt right himself
560982072139841575,debates,19,But he enables them
560982147582918667,debates,33,Hes perverted politics in america
560982277568593980,debates,147,now people are used to twitter antics_ casually calling national emergencies_ denouncing enemies and the media_ and most importantly bipartisanship
560982301421469696,debates,38,he has split the country like no other
560982361911590923,debates,43,his policies themselves arent even terrible
560982399895207947,debates,50,its how he made the public see politics that sucks
560982517650554900,debates,39,I hope 2020 a decent candidate will win
560982548172242964,debates,57,I dont even care if dems or reps its all the same anyways
560982574730575884,debates,44,just please_ someone who rationalizes things
560982718029103121,debates,63,I only know yang from memes tbh... I doubt he as a serious base
560982753353531392,debates,47,And the UBI? Im not sure how to feel about that
560982789919342598,debates,49,I dont think its a good idea to implement UBI now
560982839198220309,debates,40,actually UBI is almost never a good idea
560982929770020874,debates,84,well_ Im rooting for bernie again as in 2016_ but I wont be making myself false hope
560982982672908289,debates,44,Will do_ I liked the ones with musk and neil
560983005900963890,debates,31,Rogan makes interesting podcats
560983033080053801,debates,32,even if he himself is a bit uhhh
560983066827292674,debates,23,politically disoriented
560983128949391371,debates,34,yeah I know joe rogan is joe rogan
560983155147014164,debates,46,but Ill take the L to find out more about yang
560983213799899137,debates,39,I dont think UBI is the humane solution
560983231663439902,debates,12,note the "B"
560983256485330957,debates,28,basic means: bare sustenance
560983291625472030,debates,34,food_ and maybe a shitty apartment
560983354145636352,debates,73,if theres no healthcare and you get injured_ good luck paying it from BUI
560983428795727873,debates,68,I think the better solution is to strengthen social security instead
560983466276028456,debates,47,On all fronts. education_ healthcare_ transport
560983551676252170,debates,67,Sure_ but thats just social security with added luxury pocket money
560983585343930369,debates,53,I mean itd be nice_ but I dont think its realistic rn
560983604960690189,debates,33,And american would not support it
560983732404748288,debates,109,Sure_ but try to get americans to support social system AND UBI in one? They barely tolerate one individually
560983763853770812,debates,41,Also_ all at the same time is unrealistic
560983780064624640,debates,36,cant be implemented this fast either
560983829049901058,debates,42,lets just start by improving social system
560983864579719171,debates,68,I really think single payer is the first big step the US has to take
560983918699085824,debates,45,so ill just be happy if they get that in 2020
560983962340687872,debates,55,oh and maybe a president who doesnt deny climate change
560983981038764036,debates,8,cause uh
560983994628309006,debates,30,we dont have that many planets
560984061913333761,debates,25,I wouldnt say brainwashed
560984078501937155,debates,34,the culture is just pro capitalism
560984091227324416,debates,19,indoctrinated maybe
560984148379172874,debates,28,but everyone is_ to a degree
560984249734266890,debates,48,the US people have all that american dream stuff
560984262954844181,debates,28,which is very pro capitalist
560984279614750720,debates,35,so theyll be more biased towards it
560984348984213505,debates,102,Its not really brainwashing_ its just lack of other political opportunities with a free market culture
560984395134140418,debates,37,the two party thing is really hurtful
560984415925436428,debates,31,and the electoral college is uh
560984482342109186,debates,63,Please switch to a linearly translated multi party system USA t
560984614315884546,debates,24,This is quite ironic but
560984636675719206,debates,31,the US needs to be democratized
560984677549080576,debates,69,I reckon theyd do it themselves but theres probably not enough oil...
560984739100491777,debates,30,yeah its not propaganda really
560984791487610898,debates,72,I mean you grow up with social systems that work and you wanna keep that
560984798336909352,debates,16,its common sense
560984879806939178,debates,105,even the most free market party here doesnt want to abolish free healthcare_ its just become a no brainer
560984945342939136,debates,51,The SPD screwed itself by coalitioning with the CDU
560985045310111785,debates,79,I will vote left for now_ maybe if the SPD reestablished itself ill switch back
560985136553000971,debates,107,<@!266048997381242890> Minimum wage_ social housing_ homeless assistance_ public transport_ green energy...
560985158145146891,debates,19,the list is endless
560985212637544451,debates,32,our left isnt nationalist at all
560985244279504927,debates,39,radical? Depends what radical is to you
560985254156828705,debates,12,Oh we do too
560985270145515521,debates,26,The SPD wanted to raise it
560985284896882708,debates,34,they gave that up in the coalition
560985381982568510,debates,62,I mean protecting yourself from imperialism is not nationalism
