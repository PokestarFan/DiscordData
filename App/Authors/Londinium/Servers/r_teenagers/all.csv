560976468524400640,debates,49,how come they spend similar % on healthcare then?
560976491211653131,debates,39,could it be the US system sucks? No way
560976658161598467,debates,131,supply and demand? Like the insulin prices of 800$? We should not fuck with that? Insulin costs scraps everywhere else in the world
560976704429096960,debates,76,If you dont intervene_ big pharma just squeezes every penny out of customers
560976757298167828,debates,101,Not to mention that they might not even cure customers since yknow_ that would be a loss for business

560977290486349826,debates,64,Why should the rich get better healthcare <@!226566343456063489>
560977345327005707,debates,32,Are the poor less worthy of life
