560976194061991936,r/teenagers,debates,44,you need to change the system if its failing

560976468524400640,r/teenagers,debates,49,how come they spend similar % on healthcare then?
560976491211653131,r/teenagers,debates,39,could it be the US system sucks? No way
560976658161598467,r/teenagers,debates,131,supply and demand? Like the insulin prices of 800$? We should not fuck with that? Insulin costs scraps everywhere else in the world
560976704429096960,r/teenagers,debates,76,If you dont intervene_ big pharma just squeezes every penny out of customers
560976757298167828,r/teenagers,debates,101,Not to mention that they might not even cure customers since yknow_ that would be a loss for business

560977073259151375,r/teenagers,debates,70,more taxes would help expand infrastructure for many thigns fastert ho
560977176007278624,r/teenagers,debates,65,I want public healthcare for everyone_ and private to be optional
560977221192384541,r/teenagers,debates,31,I'd say its doable in 3-4 years
560977245087334402,r/teenagers,debates,33,If they would start reforms today
560977290486349826,r/teenagers,debates,64,Why should the rich get better healthcare <@!226566343456063489>
560977345327005707,r/teenagers,debates,32,Are the poor less worthy of life

560977498372964362,r/teenagers,debates,70,Its not actually_ public system is faster than private here oftentimes
560977575694827548,r/teenagers,debates,42,<@!411880149273935872> Theyre not starving
560977604765810728,r/teenagers,debates,37,theyre dying from 800$ insulin prices

560978411292721154,r/teenagers,debates,37,this one is just deaths from diabetes
560978988067979284,r/teenagers,debates,33,americans are a bit different tbh
560979006837751818,r/teenagers,debates,38,french people riot over a new fuel tax
560979034486341653,r/teenagers,debates,51,americans sit out everything without batting an eye
560979066551926804,r/teenagers,debates,32,chatteled to capitalism_ its sad
560979111799947269,r/teenagers,debates,30,the poor are indeed pissed tho
560979159187193886,r/teenagers,debates,93,<@!266048997381242890> Oh_ the french gov gave permission to open fire with live ammo on them
560979179563384835,r/teenagers,debates,31,I cant wait for the guillotines
560979224706547713,r/teenagers,debates,36,In case it escalates i shoud mention
560979248068820993,r/teenagers,debates,29,not if they just stand around
560979302456360980,r/teenagers,debates,99,but they torched a market recently and after that the police was given shoot orders "if threatened"
560979652965957643,r/teenagers,debates,66,ok found some stats_ germany has ~1300 death annualy from diabetes
560979670884155402,r/teenagers,debates,16,the us has 69000
560979690727276554,r/teenagers,debates,33,germany has 1/4 of the population
560979714173566986,r/teenagers,debates,52,Its safe to assume somethings wrong here I would say
560979822759772162,r/teenagers,debates,59,yeah thats the problem_ that its so open to interpretation.
560979868968419328,r/teenagers,debates,74,they killed 2 people up until now_ but that was blunt force_ not live ammo
560979900111257601,r/teenagers,debates,38,I hope they dont actually shoot anyone
560979928854822912,r/teenagers,debates,69,but if they do I hope the french torch the entire government to ashes
560979955559825418,r/teenagers,debates,35,I admire their revolutionary spirit
560980220505620490,r/teenagers,debates,95,they are literally fighting against the president raising taxes and eliminating social security
560980282811875359,r/teenagers,debates,37,the left always looks bad in the west
560980289669693450,r/teenagers,debates,13,its by design
560980447127928843,r/teenagers,debates,84,well shit I want it to go as peaceful as possible but I wont stop anyone from revvin
560980495790374941,r/teenagers,debates,38,at least its better than doing nothing
560981896176336898,r/teenagers,debates,211,btw I found an NPR article on insulin if youre still interested <@!411880149273935872> NLhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/01/641615877/insulins-high-cost-leads-to-lethal-rationing?t=1553818115066
560981947271086090,r/teenagers,debates,75,<@!324626144664223744> Maybe. Thats what the guys in weimar thought im sure
560982011637006336,r/teenagers,debates,77,And not making any implications about trump but he gave the alt right a voice
560982063789113355,r/teenagers,debates,60,Not intentionally really_ I dont think hes alt right himself
560982072139841575,r/teenagers,debates,19,But he enables them
560982147582918667,r/teenagers,debates,33,Hes perverted politics in america
560982277568593980,r/teenagers,debates,147,now people are used to twitter antics_ casually calling national emergencies_ denouncing enemies and the media_ and most importantly bipartisanship
560982301421469696,r/teenagers,debates,38,he has split the country like no other
560982361911590923,r/teenagers,debates,43,his policies themselves arent even terrible
560982399895207947,r/teenagers,debates,50,its how he made the public see politics that sucks
560982517650554900,r/teenagers,debates,39,I hope 2020 a decent candidate will win
560982548172242964,r/teenagers,debates,57,I dont even care if dems or reps its all the same anyways
560982574730575884,r/teenagers,debates,44,just please_ someone who rationalizes things
560982718029103121,r/teenagers,debates,63,I only know yang from memes tbh... I doubt he as a serious base
560982753353531392,r/teenagers,debates,47,And the UBI? Im not sure how to feel about that
560982789919342598,r/teenagers,debates,49,I dont think its a good idea to implement UBI now
560982839198220309,r/teenagers,debates,40,actually UBI is almost never a good idea
560982929770020874,r/teenagers,debates,84,well_ Im rooting for bernie again as in 2016_ but I wont be making myself false hope
560982982672908289,r/teenagers,debates,44,Will do_ I liked the ones with musk and neil
560983005900963890,r/teenagers,debates,31,Rogan makes interesting podcats
560983033080053801,r/teenagers,debates,32,even if he himself is a bit uhhh
560983066827292674,r/teenagers,debates,23,politically disoriented
560983128949391371,r/teenagers,debates,34,yeah I know joe rogan is joe rogan
560983155147014164,r/teenagers,debates,46,but Ill take the L to find out more about yang
560983213799899137,r/teenagers,debates,39,I dont think UBI is the humane solution
560983231663439902,r/teenagers,debates,12,note the "B"
560983256485330957,r/teenagers,debates,28,basic means: bare sustenance
560983291625472030,r/teenagers,debates,34,food_ and maybe a shitty apartment
560983354145636352,r/teenagers,debates,73,if theres no healthcare and you get injured_ good luck paying it from BUI
560983428795727873,r/teenagers,debates,68,I think the better solution is to strengthen social security instead
560983466276028456,r/teenagers,debates,47,On all fronts. education_ healthcare_ transport
560983551676252170,r/teenagers,debates,67,Sure_ but thats just social security with added luxury pocket money
560983585343930369,r/teenagers,debates,53,I mean itd be nice_ but I dont think its realistic rn
560983604960690189,r/teenagers,debates,33,And american would not support it
560983732404748288,r/teenagers,debates,109,Sure_ but try to get americans to support social system AND UBI in one? They barely tolerate one individually
560983763853770812,r/teenagers,debates,41,Also_ all at the same time is unrealistic
560983780064624640,r/teenagers,debates,36,cant be implemented this fast either
560983829049901058,r/teenagers,debates,42,lets just start by improving social system
560983864579719171,r/teenagers,debates,68,I really think single payer is the first big step the US has to take
560983918699085824,r/teenagers,debates,45,so ill just be happy if they get that in 2020
560983962340687872,r/teenagers,debates,55,oh and maybe a president who doesnt deny climate change
560983981038764036,r/teenagers,debates,8,cause uh
560983994628309006,r/teenagers,debates,30,we dont have that many planets
560984061913333761,r/teenagers,debates,25,I wouldnt say brainwashed
560984078501937155,r/teenagers,debates,34,the culture is just pro capitalism
560984091227324416,r/teenagers,debates,19,indoctrinated maybe
560984148379172874,r/teenagers,debates,28,but everyone is_ to a degree
