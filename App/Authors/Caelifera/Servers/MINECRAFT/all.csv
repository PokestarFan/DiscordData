560651512485773322,minecraft,62,I have to admit_ 1.10 in Bedrock is kind of unplayable for me.
560651919652159500,minecraft,154,I'm saying it's unplayable because ever since 1.9 on Bedrock_ there has been this weird freezing bug every few seconds_ making the entire game unplayable.
560651973104500746,minecraft,34,Can't even play on servers either.
