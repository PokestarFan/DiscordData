558754905687457807,minecraft,52,My favorite block is the Light Grey Concrete blocks.
558754953468837900,minecraft,20,Maybe Blue Concrete.
558755010658304010,minecraft,17,Or Gray Concrete.
558755085283360802,minecraft,40,But I'm strong with Light Grey Concrete.
558755187158810645,minecraft,39,There's one thing I hate in this world.
558755253042937856,minecraft,51,And it's videos that explain why Minecraft: "died".
558755294960680996,minecraft,21,They dissed concrete.
558755340787646465,minecraft,30,They dissed glazed terracotta.
558755433490153503,minecraft,59,They dissed any new thing Minecraft has added after 1.8.10.
558755490255863839,minecraft,22,Why do they make them?
558755707684520027,minecraft,79,Or because they're sad about Minecraft not being fun or active to them anymore.
558755978770907146,minecraft,113,I mean_ Optimus (The creator of 'The Day that Minecraft Died') don't seem like the kind of guy to want attention.
558756084236681246,minecraft,40,He seems like some guy who is nostalgic.
558756109708558359,minecraft,24,And can't accept change.
558756157720625182,minecraft,32,Like every person of the planet/
558756266177069056,minecraft,21,Ladies and gentlemen.
558756292404183041,minecraft,13,We found one.
558756368572743711,minecraft,34,We found a "old minecraft player".
558756437879291915,minecraft,47,Who apparently knows what's good for Minecraft.
558756523535368215,minecraft,18,Excavation Update.
558756573879599104,minecraft,36,Like_ adding mineshafts to villages.
558756660626325504,minecraft,30,And non abandoned strongholds.
558756700191195167,minecraft,32,Would be an interesting concept.
558756936024195101,minecraft,90,You know how Terraria added new caves and other underground stuff in 1.3? That'll be 1.15.
558757142660907059,minecraft,60,Color UpdateNLAquatic UpdateNLVillage UpdateNLExcavation Update
558757173757214740,minecraft,18,Makes total sense.
558757374739873792,minecraft,56,...This guy is running this conversation up the asphalt.
558757451499831299,minecraft,47,With spam saying how Minecraft is "repetitive".
558757567367479340,minecraft,22,Not trying to be rude.
558757627379843092,minecraft,22,Anyway_ is that a fox?
558757657977159754,minecraft,8,Dawww...
558757746972033047,minecraft,42,Can't wait to see this little guy in 1.14.
558757808137437184,minecraft,55,Ever since Mo' Creatures made foxes in Minecraft first.
558757884838805559,minecraft,28,I'm just dying to see foxes.
558757938378965002,minecraft,15,Ain't he dopey?
558757994066608142,minecraft,17,Pigs have it too.
558758178427240504,minecraft,58,What's wrong with you and change_ <@!251808367368994816> ?
558758364629172260,minecraft,5,I do.
558758467482025992,minecraft,59,I'm concrete when it comes to playing games like Minecraft.
558758495508365322,minecraft,8,Oh no...
558758523060748376,minecraft,26,I hear thunder outside....
558758570829676567,minecraft,36,In Minecraft and outside of my game.
558758604602343424,minecraft,26,'course_ what'd ya expect?
558758673221156883,minecraft,39,You expect the MC Staff to be no shows?
558758779240316938,minecraft,31,You could just live underwater.
558758808210636810,minecraft,21,Or live on an island.
558758834554798183,minecraft,19,Or in the Badlands.
558758863331917831,minecraft,15,Or in a desert/
558758898362875934,minecraft,16,Or in the swamp/
558758978511699988,minecraft,28,Or in the extreme hills_ or-
558759074104082475,minecraft,38,```French Narrator: One Hour Later.```
558759150331625518,minecraft,56,...Or you could dig straight down and live in a dungeon.
558759201711718401,minecraft,30,The possibilities are endless!
558759387624243228,minecraft,38,You strike me as...The impatient type.
558759561163440128,minecraft,62,And the type who plays modded 1.8.10 and barely anything else.
558759726867808304,minecraft,4,....
558759778747154458,minecraft,31,It's a pretty stormy day today.
558759865170788358,minecraft,48,The clouds are darkening_ the air is freezing...
558759909458706442,minecraft,37,On days like this_ people like you...
558759937593966613,minecraft,26,SHOULD BE BURNING IN HELL.
558760166095585281,minecraft,53,<@558757599311298721> "What kind of monster are you?"
558760357473157130,minecraft,81,<@558757599311298721> Nah_ I wanna cover you in concrete powder to suffocate you.
558760420450631720,minecraft,51,Because good lord_ where did your parents go wrong?
558760848638738432,minecraft,166,Sometimes I'd wish the Minecraft staff could just face-palm in unison right now to some of these nostalgic players of Minecraft saying that the game is getting worse.
558761107058196502,minecraft,20,Excuse me_ but what?
558761295957065738,minecraft,23,Everyone on the planet.
558761410629206027,minecraft,91,Minecraft getting a sequel would mean people would have to pay for an update for Minecraft.
558761541470781441,minecraft,34,This game don't need a new engine/
558761633497743360,minecraft,53,As the saying goes_ "If it ain't broke don't fix it."
558761736845656086,minecraft,27,Minecraft is ever updating.
558762175846547474,minecraft,208,The reason why players like you get tuned out by the Minecraft staff is because you guys can't seem to want anything except getting doped up with some sparkly_ blender thrown_ haphazardly thrown in additions.
558762341429149727,minecraft,102,You know_ people play tested new additions in Minecraft to see if they're fit to be in the final game.
558763061159133194,minecraft,199,The reason why things like new biomes and such aren't just getting thrown out there_ is because they actually care about not overinflating the game with so may things_ that it becomes out of control.

558764341629943820,minecraft,4,GAH!
558764376081825822,minecraft,22,I'm getting rained on!
558764401008705556,minecraft,15,By actual rain!
558764518399016976,minecraft,40,Yes!NLIt's IN Minecraft_ you cement head!
558764656403939348,minecraft,26,My head is pretty compact.
558765353921150986,minecraft,74,"Minecraft is on a downward trend on Google Trends_ so Minecraft is dead."
558765394228281364,minecraft,6,*clap*
558765426109186048,minecraft,24,Good logic there_ buddy.
558765492232388608,minecraft,25,Just some good ol' logic.
558765814644342814,minecraft,90,Do better research if you're just going to go make a bold claim like Minecraft being dead.
558765888191594506,minecraft,52,Since I bought Minecraft only a mere few months ago.
558765947029291029,minecraft,35,And bough pocket edition years ago.
558766191305555969,minecraft,31,Minecraft's update's dropping?!
558766279398391811,minecraft,13,*pounds fist*
558766305767981083,minecraft,8,AW YEAH!
558766334087790602,minecraft,10,I'm ready!
558766360465768459,minecraft,11,I'm pumped!
558766504124874825,minecraft,12,I'm no baby!
558766540611256320,minecraft,25,So I locked it on normal.
558766605438550037,minecraft,26,And went into a mineshaft.
558766681066045450,minecraft,39,Unfortunately_ the cave spiders got me.
558766719665963028,minecraft,12,A shame too.
558766749382737930,minecraft,20,I was doing so good.
558766787110502400,minecraft,26,Now I'm startin' all over.
558766827962892289,minecraft,19,Back to square one.
558766860791971870,minecraft,23,It's more fun that way.
558766903573741569,minecraft,20,Keeps me on my toes.
558767242372710400,minecraft,129,Look at this boy tryin' to criticize Jeb and anyone involved with updating Minecraft. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OxvsE2W1HQ
558767321825411103,minecraft,38,His own nostalgia got the best of 'em.
558767720498331658,minecraft,24,You can reset your skin.
558767821203701780,minecraft,32,A concrete feature_ if you will.
558767863205199882,minecraft,9,Hey_ man!
558767888148987906,minecraft,8,Welcome!
558767918981054474,minecraft,19,Have some concrete.
558768014770569219,minecraft,27,That's good_ that's good...
558768341712371713,minecraft,60,I don't got Discord's App 'cause I heard it takes your data.
558768395865161728,minecraft,12,So I refuse.
558768988260139009,minecraft,17,Fartin' mosquito?
558769018673037325,minecraft,24,What kinda name is that?
558769149900357632,minecraft,6,...ok.
558769256502788098,minecraft,36,Whatever paves your road_ I suppose.
558769392486187018,minecraft,11,It happens.
558769790030839814,minecraft,33,I'd be honored to join your game.
558769819508539392,minecraft,24,Just to pave your roads.
558769854606344196,minecraft,12,And build...
558769898914840577,minecraft,40,Pretty much anything involving concrete.
558769956506959882,minecraft,36,How many times have I said concrete?
558770193673879563,minecraft,13,Uhhh_ anywho.
558770237819060254,minecraft,25,Time to update Minecraft!
558770286993080362,minecraft,20,Nooo_ not the kitty!
558770964876492825,multiplayer,39,You want a builder? You got me covered!
558785509732646934,minecraft,33,Nothing like a good ol' buildin'!
558810192100458506,multiplayer,18,I can be a builder
559021219328819200,minecraft,27,Does experience taste good?
559021632828735504,minecraft,47,Don't judge me_ he was in the way of my statue!
559021851360100353,minecraft,11,A turtle...
559022297353289728,minecraft,16,*eats a diamond*
559022822249201680,minecraft,6,......
559022877957947408,minecraft,50,I don't know why everyone's givin' me funny looks.
559025591551131660,minecraft,67,"WHAT THE FAKK IS THIS?!" "FAKKING SPONGE CAKE?!" "WHAT THE FAKK?!"
559029560520343552,minecraft,32,That name reminds me of someone.
559030468935417856,minecraft,11,MURDER BED.
559031182776467476,minecraft,171,That bug where you get stuck in a wall after enterin' a bed is something I associate with Tobsuscus's playthrough of Minecraft. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw9air9SIy0
559031520522666010,minecraft,13,Am I a felon?
559031595877793792,minecraft,42,For accidentally killing a small villager?
559031924316962819,minecraft,32,"STOP BREAKIN' DA LAW_ ASSHOLE!"
559032119989501959,minecraft,41,It's illegal if there's a law against it.
559032185798262784,minecraft,55,There's no law that prevents me from chugging concrete.
559032322532311040,minecraft,47,But there is one against distributing the game.
559032434373558272,minecraft,51,The game constantly tells you not to distribute it.
559034543487713312,minecraft,33,I want to make concrete pancakes.
559034759020281889,minecraft,216,For some reason. when I was searchin' up concrete pancakes_ this came up. https://m.facebook.com/hbdessertcafe/videos/no-pancakes-nor-waffles-again-today-just-freshly-poured-concrete-pipe-work-and-a/1391966084235778/
