558430926254637056,MINECRAFT,off-topic,37,<@!153109536230735872>  roux or cfop?
558431253712470017,MINECRAFT,off-topic,112,...they're two different methods of solving rubiks cubes. for example_ the beginner's method is a subset of CFOP
558431622358237185,MINECRAFT,off-topic,101,that's cfop. Cross_ F2L_ OLL_ PLL (or Cross_ First-two-layers_ orient-last-layer_ permute-last-layer)
558431935458836505,MINECRAFT,off-topic,75,you can technically get by only knowing two algorithms for the second layer
558432001674313760,MINECRAFT,off-topic,82,one to put an edge on the left side of a face_ and one to put it on the right side
558432170352574480,MINECRAFT,off-topic,55,But uh_ yeah_ I know a bit about solving rubiks cubes ðŸ‘€
558432538725449738,MINECRAFT,off-topic,146,If you're practicing it constantly_ it takes about a week to three weeks to solve it consistently by yourself without having to look at references
558432947921879043,MINECRAFT,off-topic,18,_hopefully fixed?_
558440292844437524,MINECRAFT,off-topic,113,<@!153109536230735872> next is to complete the top face_ which if you solved the white one first_ would be yellow
558794959587901451,MINECRAFT,off-topic,66,"sir please take your mask off"NL"I'm a bank robber"NL"oh_ carry on"
558795022875754527,MINECRAFT,off-topic,40,in all seriousness_ hope everyone's okay
558795334881509398,MINECRAFT,off-topic,26,bank robbing is soo 1800's
558795500388745216,MINECRAFT,off-topic,41,nowadays most of the time they get caught
