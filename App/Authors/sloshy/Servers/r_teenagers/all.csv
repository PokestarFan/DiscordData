559097066454908929,serious-personal-2,664,currently at a robotics competition and i walked past a girl crying and rather than feeling sorry for her i felt envious like an absolute jackass. all i’ve wanted for the last week is to cry on my bed for an hour or so like an absolute bitch. i’ve just stopped trying because ik it’s not going to happen. i went back to the stands for a minute and i was a dick to absolutely everyone. at first someone asked for what i thought was a portable battery and i just said later_ felt like an asshole and got mine out. they ended up needing a cord instead and i gave them one i knew was broken and left because i was scared they would break mine. what tf is wrong with me
