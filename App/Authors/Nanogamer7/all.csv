558756875869356099,MINECRAFT,builds,119,Does someone have a discussion topiuc for me to participate in_ I wanna reach lvl 5 so I don't have to go over to imgur
558756933562138645,MINECRAFT,builds,4,Here
558757038776385567,MINECRAFT,builds,23,Which version and when?
558757237401845787,MINECRAFT,builds,31,Oh sorry I only play on java :/
558757312828014617,MINECRAFT,builds,23,But thx for the offer ðŸ˜‰
558762320805888001,MINECRAFT,builds,35,hwo much time did that take so far?
558765534531813377,MINECRAFT,builds,21,Wait_ how? Worldedit?
558765601573699599,MINECRAFT,builds,32,If that's built by hand_ respect
558765628425764894,MINECRAFT,builds,24,Otherwise_ still respect
558765711061680130,MINECRAFT,builds,2,xD
558765794083864583,MINECRAFT,builds,13,seems logical
558765945401901056,MINECRAFT,builds,99,do you use a spherical brush and smooth it out afterwards or do you have some more advanced method?
558766110908874763,MINECRAFT,builds,2,ok
558766157700661294,MINECRAFT,builds,27,good luck decorating it ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜›
558766242765209631,MINECRAFT,builds,7,will it
558766343520780317,MINECRAFT,builds,27,Yeah it's kinda hard to use
558766371337404419,MINECRAFT,builds,3,Hey
558766567966507008,MINECRAFT,builds,2,gg
558766584869683201,MINECRAFT,builds,14,lost anything?
558767111372144660,MINECRAFT,builds,98,But why should minecraft be smooth_ our screens made out of pixels would negate the effect anyways
558767566160527361,MINECRAFT,builds,16,How do you know?
558767707378679809,MINECRAFT,builds,76,depends on what you wanna build on it_ sometimes the build should come first
558767782733545492,MINECRAFT,builds,49,well if yopu already finished the built itself...
558767885900578906,MINECRAFT,bot-commands,5,!rank
558768097490632704,MINECRAFT,builds,33,oh wow_ that really looks awesome
558768359467122688,MINECRAFT,builds,72,or you make a new world and copy the tower(s) in afterwards using mcedit
558768481898725379,MINECRAFT,builds,11,qorks awell
558768590598438953,MINECRAFT,builds,32,was about to say that aswell thx
558768802838478886,MINECRAFT,builds,45,but lvl 5 isn't hard at all on mee bot anyway
558769254522945553,MINECRAFT,builds,158,back to builds: I just noticed you don't really have a render distance that high_ so most of the landscape surrounding your towers won't be visible anyways...
558769292477202432,MINECRAFT,builds,22,are you aware of that?
558769368754814996,MINECRAFT,builds,52,(that btw what I meant with lvling up fast with mee)
558769544408203293,MINECRAFT,builds,55,oh you will turn it up for good screenshots afterwards?
558769742433746984,MINECRAFT,builds,3,wow
558769901532217354,MINECRAFT,builds,21,looks **really** good
558769953835057155,MINECRAFT,builds,24,how long did *that* take
558770147645718533,MINECRAFT,builds,49,only?! I wouldn't be able to do that in such time
558770175248171008,MINECRAFT,builds,7,respect
558770366349312001,MINECRAFT,builds,48,wow you are really doing big things with we then
558770556368060436,MINECRAFT,builds,31,Yeah sure_ I'd love to see them
558771027253919772,MINECRAFT,builds,63,you should definitely post some of them on reddit (r/minecraft)
558771059269304353,MINECRAFT,builds,27,people there will love them
558771543597907978,MINECRAFT,builds,16,there's more O_O
558771873215807528,MINECRAFT,builds,83,probably still better than many of my attempts at terraforming/large scale building
558772192826097674,MINECRAFT,builds,7,respect
558772366914748419,MINECRAFT,builds,97,<@557711112750104576> look like a nice little project suitable for survival mode aswell ðŸ˜‰ like it
558772554668441622,MINECRAFT,builds,1,ðŸ˜¦
558772728962875422,MINECRAFT,builds,29,Haven't you made any backups?
558772751092023309,MINECRAFT,builds,3,nvm
558773042285641740,MINECRAFT,builds,109,you could ask in <#302987265229979649>_ maybe someone there is more familiar with (more or less) broken saves
558773090222604309,MINECRAFT,builds,34,What do youz have neter bound  to?
559021207933026314,MINECRAFT,builds,84,No one said you can't do that in survival <@189346627574562816> it's just reall hard
