559036126690672648,anime,357,as for weird romance themes which i am a fan of_ Nande Koko ni Sensei ga interests me because of teacher x student_ but looks like it might just be ecchi trash. No siscon animes this season_ i think that terrible one last season killed the genre for good. There is also a shes-1000-years-old-so-its-not-illegal loli anime which seems to have taken its place
559038502965084161,anime,233,ever since i watched 90%+ of all the past animes i would ever want to watch i pretty much read manga and ln's more often now than anime. When I start watching a seasonal anime i get impatient and just read the source material usually
559038747228766209,anime,192,some exceptions would be like re zero_ since it is a ln. I do read ln's but only if the writing is exceptional and the story has something in particular i really want to see develop right away
559038806288760833,anime,43,also i really like how the anime is adapted
559039116755337239,anime,58,i read slime tensei like a year before the anime or longer
559039135432704038,anime,20,was pretty surprised
559039383249092638,anime,32,the anime caught up to the manga
559039420582330369,anime,65,i didnt even realize and had kept waiting for more manga chapters
