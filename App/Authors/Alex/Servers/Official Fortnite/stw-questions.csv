558804750989262878,61,Is the glitch with one-two punch intended or purely a glitch?
558805329958141955,102,When I phase shift it causes anti material charge to cost zero energy_ instead of the listed 20% less.
558805444987191296,31,Wait_ nvm. It is for each hero.
558805476465442846,25,Thought was just 20%. lol
558805637971312651,73,Was it always for each hero though? I don't recall it being one of those.
558805836542115851,56,Would "Heavy Attack" count as melee weapon heavy attack?
558806253946798091,17,The pickaxe does.
558806552211882001,72,Anti Material Charge is pickaxe heavy attack for outlanders and it does.
558806625415200768,38,It is the heavy attack of the pickaxew
558806890432299009,106,it is a perk_ not so much an ability.NLIt literally says "activate heavy attack with your pickaxe equipped"
558807196847177739,71,Then why would they call it "Class Perks" instead of "Class Abilities"?
558807249946935298,27,Confusing wording_ perhaps?
558807622908903425,69,They called them perks though_ not abilities.NLThat is just confusing.
558807704009703435,50,I guess you would also call loot llama an ability?
558808175097413651,70,That is what I was trying to clarify.NLThank-you <@!419465878485204992>
558808200531542016,25,About the pickaxe I mean.
558808384862945310,29,hmm?NLI am still able to play.
558808620951666690,21,In the event location
558808668829646876,17,After Twine Peaks
558808962791637014,60,I don't lose keen eyes when I switch from the pickaxe though
558809023122636800,33,Just the in the zone bonus damage
558809037874003989,14,and movespeed.
558809103464529940,41,It's been like it since the hero loadout.
558809621268004884,49,It doesn't turn off when you switch from pickaxe.
558809805955792896,48,makes it a good reason to run outlanders though.
558809869180862486,47,Seeing loot can be somewhat valuable sometimes.
558810125901758466,48,I run constructor more than anything these days.
558810215563395094,45,That or quite a bit of sledgehammer/calamity.
558810341006639115,42,How do we complete the gunslinger mission.
558810360447238154,29,Where do you need to explore?
558810472246149128,21,What mission is what?
558810816204374026,3,yes
558810853202329608,16,dw_ it finished.
558822711191666710,80,<@257356780361744394>  Depends_ can you post here exactly what you posted there?
558823269848055828,108,<@!137010064195059712> It isn't wrong channel_ I asked what he posted in the trade channel that got deleted.
558823363758391306,68,<@257356780361744394> Maybe with the "." after each entry? Not sure.
558823523066314762,41,If that doesn't work_ then I am not sure.
558823590250938383,35,It is limited to one post per hour.
558823628280430592,45,Regardless of whether it gets deleted or not.
558827561518497802,28,The pinned post says hour :/
558827675742109726,12,Under how to
558828213002829839,92,I didn't think it was hourly_ but am not sure personally so only got pinned post to go from.
558828725471543296,65,That's kinda stupid. They should fix whichever of those is wrong.
558829070977073182,9,Drumroll.
558829079764140032,1,ðŸ˜„
