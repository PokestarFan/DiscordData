560640142008778777,3,sam
560640144974151681,1,e
560640427934613532,40,depends on how you play your minions tbh
560640449425965059,34,if you stack them they die quicker
560640715751817238,3,yea
560640733372088321,34,certain people abuse that mechanic
560641106279268367,39,you can counter it fine with black hole
560641283983409155,11,no you dont
560641347657138206,41,i counter it everygame when i can with BH
560641360105963531,28,its not as hard as you think
560641428364066826,3,sec
560641442679357471,27,ill explain after this game
560641463520591892,11,some people
560641471426854912,15,play combustion
560641487847686154,24,then the minion after it
560641504369049608,12,like croaker
560641519380463616,28,but you can still counter it
560641555346489375,27,you dont need to predict it
560641622681845775,57,also_ i dont care those who use combustion in their decks
560641680521428995,108,its when certain players knowingly combust 1 living statue against a guardian healer just to kill the healer
560641756484337675,119,when if it wasnt bugged this would be worthless since it wouldnt kill anything and the healer would reheal the guardian
560641954455748609,28,yea then youre not an abuser
560642503133626381,67,theres a cast time + time when the minion is marked to then explode
560642588030533632,35,its really not as hard as you think
560642710474588210,15,try it sometime
560642758063161344,44,it definately makes it harder than 3 seconds
560643282867191818,33,how do i check my latency in game
560643742223040522,37,/showstats does nothing for me ingame
560643899350188033,39,is there a command to see all commands?
560643930262077460,13,would be nice
560648600313528330,1,^
560648641761640448,45,means youre about 1/5th of the way to the top
560648877359759370,64,1054_ is this in premade 2s btw? if its in 2s relog and reset it
