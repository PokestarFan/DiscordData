558810289273962500,73,im glad they gave old gen 1.13 before they stopped updating them for good
558810590257086475,89,1.12 would've been disappointing at least to leave old gen with_ i dont like it very much
558810747279376384,55,what was 1.10 again? 1.10 and 1.11 i dont even remember
558810773221015573,26,was 1.10 woodland mansions
558810837310242818,23,wow what an epic update
558811165703274496,99,ive never encountered a woodland mansion on singleplayer so they aren't very important to me hahaha

558815845900484659,122,ive been getting back into minecraft lately i feel like this server is going to be the one im most active on for a while üëÄ
558816075031248916,53,yes maybe the 150 thousand people here like minecraft
558816098552774676,1,ü§î
558816665886785539,84,valko if im being honest the way you talk in the server sounds like a bot response üòÇ
558816764889137197,41,minecraft dungeons? <@540655543887593476>
558817055751798784,59,dungeons hasnt been released yet lmao <@540655543887593476>
558817094804832256,30,its coming out later this year
558817597131325469,47,bedrock got 1.10_ which brought shields finally
558817659110686725,91,im ecstatic that we finally have the item that the slot shouldve had to go with for 2 years
558817786718060579,56,bedrock players_ whats your opinion on 1.10 new textures
558818087152123914,116,they changed crop textures so i had an awful time trying to figure out what the mature wheat looked like on skyblock
558818153627516930,16,spam doesnt work
558818218131849276,72,mee6 gives you a random amount of xp every 60 seconds you send a message
558818241733197845,16,between 1 and 9o
558818397240950784,62,and the spam wouldn't even count for 60 seconds each to get xp
558818570306322432,29,the new default textures suck
558818645485158401,59,wheat actually looks like wheat and it bothers me immensely
558819320453398539,80,<:reactor:309478404208590849> im surprised they have a nether reactor core emoji
558819372886392892,50,its been years since ive been mentioned about them
558819538347753475,47,the old way to get a "nether" in pocket edition
558819659361681409,128,you made a complicated structure and then put the core in the center to summon a cube of netherrack and quartz with a few pigmen
558819711916310530,46,it was stupid_ and it was removed in like 2013
558822616257789982,1,I

559022929401217035,17,thanks mr bot man
559031305136766991,109,<@358662656942407690> selling accounts is against mojang's eula and terms of service and is literally illegal
559031355384659999,57,just because everyone does it doesnt mean its not illegal
559031391438897152,30,where did that logic come from
