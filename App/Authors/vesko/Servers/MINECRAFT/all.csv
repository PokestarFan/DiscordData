558762240942276612,builds,66,last time i left at here_ now it's time to continue terraforming ðŸ˜„
558765473291042816,builds,11,13-14 hours
558765602177810462,builds,2,yh
558765679239757831,builds,61,no one in their right mind will place 5million blocks by hand
558765716413743130,builds,46,and spend months on something that takes hours
558765752795136001,builds,25,for the same final result
558766018592505858,builds,41,sand sphreres and smoothing only_ for now
558766041795395585,builds,35,it's just the base of the ladnscape
558766187832672260,builds,26,that will be the easy part
558766252185747457,builds,59,hard part is dealing with that "not-so-good" smooth brush ðŸ˜„
558766543190622230,builds,14,and it crashed
558766670324301859,builds,15,hopefully i did
558766684782198795,builds,20,the thing i did wrog
558767569465638932,builds,77,i should really start making the landscape first then the build itself.. :DDD
558767645583867917,builds,80,but i guess it's a bit too late at this point_ cuz i have the entire build ready
558767939818618901,builds,0,
558767983259025419,builds,39,this_ surrounded by 6 more small towers
558768209063313429,builds,105,i should to try move it away_ delete the small towers_ make the landscape and then get back in everything
558768241095475221,builds,9,get lvl 5
558768311471702016,builds,18,cuz it's lvl 5 lol
558768370334433290,builds,16,it is 5... get 5
558768436738523137,builds,56,<@224923110120488972> or just put them in the end void ðŸ˜„
558768512382795800,builds,43,you get xp once per minute so stop spamming
558768744843968564,builds,95,if you want xp_ go in <#305580569238962186> and type there_ not to flood the channel for builds
558768830625611786,builds,1,^
558769408722599968,builds,51,why should i make it small for low renders only lol
558769648229941278,builds,0,
558769654202630155,builds,13,basically yea
558769662607884316,builds,1,ðŸ˜„
558770025394339841,builds,9,30+ hours
558770100946075648,builds,19,it's an 840x720 map
558770224665591809,builds,36,i got more stuff_ it's not just this
558770241640071198,builds,21,damn mc crashed again
558770372569464842,builds,85,you can kinda see on the background of my discord pfp that there's some other stuff ðŸ˜„
558770450218352652,builds,45,if you want i can post exactly the ones there
558770958723317772,builds,0,
558771220603207680,builds,0,
558771262063902720,builds,69,that's it_ the rest of my stuff doesn't have screenshots with shaders
558771685025644568,builds,52,yea but the rest is just old_ not that good projects
558772077642121226,builds,124,the ones on the screenshots vary from 400x400 to 840x720_ the one with the black/red tower that i do atm is 800x800_ for now
558772515455893527,builds,74,ok now i can't even start the game_ it just crashes as i enter the world..
558772656963452929,builds,99,if i don't manage to make it work i will lose the entire tower with everything i had made around it
558772726727311370,builds,63,the other 13 builds that are in that world tho.. i have backups
558772782490583040,builds,41,i do_ but it's before i started the tower
558772826253950978,builds,45,so i won't lose the rest of the maps at least
558772922966212630,builds,33,it loads 2-3 chunks and crashes..
558772952695439380,builds,33,nvm it crashed as i press "enter"
558773185064206376,builds,64,double click with mouse_ to enter the world_ that's what i meant
558773272326569993,builds,68,the issue is that i copied then pasted a selection of 6.7 mil blocks
558778282317971488,builds,4,nice
558779123674120224,support,30,this is the crash report i get
558784126748983309,support,98,mcedit loads it to one point and then the program itself crashes_ no matter what world i put in it
558784486771261451,support,107,i got in it without the optifine_ i will try to load the broken chunks and try to see what's going on there
558784692359528488,support,64,yea_ it's broken chunks that cause it_ not any mods or something
558784712760361010,support,36,it crashed the moment i reached them
558800945341792268,builds,153,after few hours of trying solutions i finally got rid of the corrupted chunks that crashed my game immediately and i have a fresh pair of chunks there xD
558801052347138048,builds,48,i'd have killed myself if i lost that tower lmao
558807056375611448,builds,34,opsieee xd_ lava got a bit spilled
558808079693512719,builds,2,^^
558809493396520970,builds,16,the nether tower
558809530377568257,builds,25,<@130194388927119361> thx
558809736720678922,builds,213,<@!402442353886887956> i moved 1/4 of the nether tower and the small tower in the end void and deleted them from their crater so i can now terraform without worrying. Also i spent few hours fixing corrupted chunks
558809740763725824,builds,3,yes
558809856342097923,builds,81,i expanded the smooth brush size to radius 850_ watch me terraform the f outta it
558809954388279296,builds,78,also i increased the //undo history to 1000_ cuz 15 was never enough for me xD
558810030665891851,builds,63,yea_ i just realized that i can do that in the .properties file
558810125163560961,builds,74,it doesn't because it's all covered in lava and only 1/4 of it_ in the end
558810318990475276,builds,76,randomtickspeed 50000 and surrounding it with barrier blocks fixed the leaks
558810347834966026,builds,1,ðŸ˜„
558810356269711380,builds,7,welcome
558810423772839957,builds,51,brushes with 6 and history of 15 really is annoying
558810570992648204,builds,39,let me try that smooth 400 brush now xD
558810627913547776,builds,88,i will just spam it in the center of the map and it will terraform the entire thing lmao
558810709698543636,builds,70,plus it won't have the disgusting edges left from small smooth brushes
558810807417307153,builds,0,

558811299069558784,builds,0,
558811330480701440,builds,19,.//undo 100 be like
558811384905990144,builds,30,why didn't i know this earlier
558811724892078080,builds,132,now that the towers are removed_ i only marked their "bottom horns" and central points_ i can start some serious w.e. terraforming ðŸ˜„
558811974243188737,builds,14,cya in 2 hours
558812178791137347,builds,108,it's better to be like that_ than instantly crashing the world every single time thus making it unplayable ðŸ˜„
558812198798098442,builds,17,i will fix it now
558817271448076299,builds,45,all of those chunks got corrupted again now..
558819329353711616,builds,285,<@!402442353886887956> apparently_ these chunks stay broken and they keep getting corrupted even after i delete them and add new ones_ so i will use the schematics for the towers to place them in the backup i made before i even started the towers and make a fresh start on that terrain
559021197380288524,builds,105,fun thing_ its several times smaller than the stuff i normally do. it just looks epic so i used it now xd
559021379647963167,builds,73,sure brb imma collect 170.000 items. thats how much the tower consists of
559022860069371910,builds,12,~~builds~~ ðŸ˜…
559039787214831618,builds,38,aquarium would be better in my opinion
559053858609954816,builds,100,i will try to build guysNLhope that it won't start crashing again and corrupting my chunks ðŸ˜„ :killme:
559058181888671765,builds,31,it needs a 3D pattern basically
559058216038957075,builds,13,^^^^^^^^^^^^^
559063151736520715,builds,30,<@!366578109404938250> bone? ðŸ˜„
559063300344774656,builds,3,hmm
559065518309376000,builds,57,then it's the shaders that make the bedrock so bright lol
559070578686820362,builds,47,why do so many people like and do only medieval
559071237247074342,builds,34,how to build a ghost ship tutorial
559088599056908466,builds,107,<@416425695632293888> that's more than 10 million blocks_ it's not physically possible to do it by hand lol
559088652752519190,builds,62,and im not that out of my mind to do such terraforming by hand
559111822725087234,builds,75,with that glass on the back its hard to see that insane pattern u had there
