558440576777715742,45,the EU is just another neoliberal institution
558440619371134977,48,free movement of people is good and all but like
558440652002689045,44,it's still an annoying neoliberal institutin
558440942697316362,70,<@148507515888336897> neoliberal means free-market economic liberalism
558441302371467266,44,while the EU is meh_ brexit is laughably bad
558441338706591765,32,and is 100% formed on xenophobia

558441625060114432,88,<@!378627967435145219> there was a lot of other reasons germany failed to conquer europe
558441671377944616,40,mostly because germany_ uh_ sorta sucked

558442044910207008,275,like i saw a video of nigel farage trying to say why brexit was good and you could clearly tell it was targeted to americans because it was like_ "the EU is a BIG GOVERNMENT and that's bad_ and the UK is trying to leave the EU because it wants SMALL GOVERNMENT which is good"
558442191392079883,48,americans are dumb but then again all anglos are

558442987340955674,154,<@148507515888336897> I mean_ it was considering that the american occupation IMMEDIATELY began testing the effects of the bombs right after the war ended
558443044857184256,96,<@414783970094350336> operation cherry blossoms at night was one of shiro ishii's crackpot plans

558443312907026462,97,The only way Germany could have won WW2 is if they weren't Germany and didn't start a global war.
558443346201149441,15,In other words_
558443385984253968,37,Axis victory was literally impossible
558443476182761521,20,Both were inevitable
558443520063438868,7,In fact
558443546596737025,53,Hitler picked the best possible time to invade Russia
558443556428054548,28,and still got his ass kicked
558443639919869967,34,Germany couldn't have taken Moscow
558443645041377311,11,or at least
558443652565696524,16,kept it for long
558443698103517205,10,not really
558443737395494913,106,Hitler invaded Russia when the mud was frozen and when Stalin was in the middle of a massive officer purge
558443772166275082,37,It was the best time to attack Russia
558443779523084359,25,and they still got fucked

558444265433333760,49,<@!378627967435145219> except they didn't do that
558444346882392091,41,the "soviet human wave tactic" myth is BS
558444428977766400,60,the USSR outproduced_ out-gunned_ and out-manned the Germans
558444438305767424,23,it's really that simple
558444535231807488,91,<@148507515888336897> the whole "1 gun or every 10 men" myth or whatever comes from a movie

558445029891506189,13,a year or two
558445081170935829,19,it's not the winter
558445157389828107,49,the USSR had some of the best generals in the war

558445329897488396,69,<@!290950188816662537> the russian winter actually helped the germans
558445338394886155,16,do you know why?
558445381717983252,53,because do you know what the russian spring was like?
558445398721691659,8,**Mud.**
558445535082709016,127,German mechanized units were able to easily slide across the ice in the winter. The spring would have bogged them down so much.
558445657338413086,115,The idea that "the winter beat the Germans" is  a myth meant to downplay the actual military prowess of the Soviets
558445764855201802,14,which ones lol
558445838892793886,72,my teacher¬†and my textbook has been wrong about history before_ so what?
558445929397485568,3,lol
558445971982516246,45,the war was mostly the americans and the USSR
558446051237953537,89,and american history has downplayed the USSR **SO MUCH** during the war_ do you know why?
558446122729734144,99,<@!378627967435145219> that's not true‚Äì some collaborated with the nazis <:joke:431536660170276864>
558446287817670706,56,yeah that's because the SS was the jankiest organization
558446476079136768,20,the SS was also just
558446492973531157,34,ran by fucking insane crazy people
558446718056923152,20,hitler was also like
558446729863888905,30,drugged up for most of the war
558446840194793479,116,the nazi german state was so fucking illogical it's a miracle that they managed to stick around for more than a year
558446860428247071,4,like
558446982180503565,109,hitler made goring in charge of economics and stuff for the exact reason that he knew nothing about economics
558447052913246238,35,<@!378627967435145219> *there were*

558448414895898627,45,we already are offering them massive tax cuts
558448431920578572,29,they don't really give a shit

558448854769598464,79,that's like saying that legalizing gay rights will give more fuel to homophobes
558448864122896395,11,which is uh
558448879469592598,29,an argument i've heard before
558448902479806467,5,sadly
558448977968627734,67,reminder that the people killing the earth have names and addresses
558449329187061761,109,y'all are giving far too many concessions and wiggle room to people who literally are murdering the earth lol

558449520799645696,126,we shouldn't be saying "ahaha no tax cuts for you" if your company is killing the earth_ we should be fucking jailing the CEOs
558449568690208818,36,maybe they'll fuckin listen for once
558449667642359838,17,wdym my own image
558449680372203540,34,what is that supposed to even mean

558450381626015749,49,you just keep saying "you're hurting your IMAGE!"
558450442472914954,27,not as much as i did before
558450503122419736,52,she gave too many concessions for the sake of optics
558451017910583308,301,i mean it's hard to work within this framework because i actually think that climate change roots from something far more systematic than just "companies" and ending climate change would require something far more than just "targetting companies"NLNLbut i don't think y'all would want to hear about that
558451219698548736,77,if you're uncomfortable attacking people_ there's a different way completely.
558451240468742144,32,would you like to hear about it?
558451465606135808,159,we could fight the overall system that caused this crisis in the first place and live a much better life while we're at it.NLNLwe could always attack capitalism.
558451520740261892,41,climate change is a crisis of capitalism.
558451680476135424,115,<@!378627967435145219> a system where production is held by private entities and said production is used for profit
558451808997998607,69,a system where production is owned by the people who actually produce
558451857308123149,8,workers!

558452215048568853,115,i like the concept of a post-scarcity post-work society too but it won't happen within the frameworks of capitalism
558452430522810409,82,the fight against climate change must be anticapitalist_ else it be simply a delay
558454955841945610,3,lol
