558442044910207008,debates,275,like i saw a video of nigel farage trying to say why brexit was good and you could clearly tell it was targeted to americans because it was like_ "the EU is a BIG GOVERNMENT and that's bad_ and the UK is trying to leave the EU because it wants SMALL GOVERNMENT which is good"

558443346201149441,debates,15,In other words_
558443385984253968,debates,37,Axis victory was literally impossible
558443476182761521,debates,20,Both were inevitable
558443520063438868,debates,7,In fact
558443546596737025,debates,53,Hitler picked the best possible time to invade Russia

558443737395494913,debates,106,Hitler invaded Russia when the mud was frozen and when Stalin was in the middle of a massive officer purge
558443772166275082,debates,37,It was the best time to attack Russia
558443779523084359,debates,25,and they still got fucked

558444265433333760,debates,49,<@!378627967435145219> except they didn't do that
558444346882392091,debates,41,the "soviet human wave tactic" myth is BS
558444428977766400,debates,60,the USSR outproduced_ out-gunned_ and out-manned the Germans
558444438305767424,debates,23,it's really that simple
558444535231807488,debates,91,<@148507515888336897> the whole "1 gun or every 10 men" myth or whatever comes from a movie

558445398721691659,debates,8,**Mud.**
558445535082709016,debates,127,German mechanized units were able to easily slide across the ice in the winter. The spring would have bogged them down so much.
558445657338413086,debates,115,The idea that "the winter beat the Germans" is  a myth meant to downplay the actual military prowess of the Soviets
558445764855201802,debates,14,which ones lol
558445838892793886,debates,72,my teacher¬†and my textbook has been wrong about history before_ so what?

558446729863888905,debates,30,drugged up for most of the war
558446840194793479,debates,116,the nazi german state was so fucking illogical it's a miracle that they managed to stick around for more than a year
558446860428247071,debates,4,like
558446982180503565,debates,109,hitler made goring in charge of economics and stuff for the exact reason that he knew nothing about economics

558448879469592598,debates,29,an argument i've heard before
558448902479806467,debates,5,sadly
558448977968627734,debates,67,reminder that the people killing the earth have names and addresses
558449329187061761,debates,109,y'all are giving far too many concessions and wiggle room to people who literally are murdering the earth lol

558450503122419736,debates,52,she gave too many concessions for the sake of optics
558451017910583308,debates,301,i mean it's hard to work within this framework because i actually think that climate change roots from something far more systematic than just "companies" and ending climate change would require something far more than just "targetting companies"NLNLbut i don't think y'all would want to hear about that
558451219698548736,debates,77,if you're uncomfortable attacking people_ there's a different way completely.

558452215048568853,debates,115,i like the concept of a post-scarcity post-work society too but it won't happen within the frameworks of capitalism
558452430522810409,debates,82,the fight against climate change must be anticapitalist_ else it be simply a delay
