560285605108514821,17,I want to believe
560990269684842497,35,like_ it's one thing to incentivise
560990424957714442,116,but after the dball nerf then rabid prowler then crystal construct then batsbatsbats then shieldguard and now stormy
560990578796396546,162,there hasn't been a card release since WHEEL OF DOOM that hasn't had at least 1-3 cards in the release pool required to be drastically nerfed in a very short time
560990588711731202,16,let that sink in
560990791846068224,48,he's already been nerfed via the guardian change
560990832274964501,51,and will almost certainly be nerfed again very soon
561003378411569162,14,yes_ yes I did
561003427614949378,26,it's not even more careful
561003447877632020,20,every. single. patch
561003492815405056,50,literally they need to actually playtest... at all
561003787678908417,17,of course it will
561003990188425216,121,fyi I pretty much nagged on Reddit so hard on pre-release caleth being broken_ they nerfed it before it was even released
561004033054212097,61,it's becoming so predictable I saw it before it even happened
561004088087674881,51,next deck will essentially be a bunch more stormies
561004112314105877,12,aoe and para
561004145989910529,34,un-interactive "sit there and die"
561004190395269150,3,yes
561004239791587330,47,pre-release the shield would last half the time
561004281046630421,27,and the taunt was automatic
561004402932973608,111,they released it nerfing the taunt (required activators) and increasing reload time of shield from 10 to 12 sec
