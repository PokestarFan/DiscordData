558758700370886656,92,except you are not in every single ring_ because there are rings more privileged than ring 0
558758862065500160,70,the pile of shit that is the Intel management engine exists in ring -3
558759132212232216,32,oh I know that meme by dual core
558759436856983562,4,well
558759451335720960,22,ME is a cpu on its own
558759489025605653,41,people refer to it as ring -3 because uhh
558759492813062167,7,reasons
558759508738834452,20,it isn't a real ring
558759569900306442,67,but it has full unrestricted access to everything running in ring 0
558759606273310780,15,so there's that
558759658022502401,6,oh_ no
558759719708131330,38,I'll eventually get around to doing it
558759846019727390,30,what the heck is that emoticon
558759936700710922,56,and why does my cursor change shape when I hover over it
558760033169440768,6,oh rip
558760050772934666,22,me_cleaner didnt work?
558760160810762260,53,wow intel really loves pushing anti-consumer shit lol
558760212652359700,62,not that amd is less guilty (they have their own thing) but eh
558760395758895114,59,it depends how you define an "anti-consumer thing"_ I guess
558760480659734529,88,ME and the like are inherently evil and you should have the right to tell it to fuck off
558760561580572684,7,oh lmao
558760566970122266,9,more like
558760571554627595,9,200 years
558760583131037698,7,no less
558760678328893441,42,there's a reason my main laptop is an X220
558760719462563840,32,can't libreboot but can coreboot
558760739167272982,15,and me_clean it
558760950409199635,3,yep
558761076716732436,93,most coreboot builds (especially those for older thinkpads) are almost 90% free (as in libre)
558761164339806212,53,with a few proprietary drivers that can't be replaced
558761356095127555,126,but if you are okay with an even older machine_ core duo machines like the T60_ X60_ X200 and T400 are all fully librebootable
558761616775315479,32,open source != open contribution
558761735830634517,70,I don't think making something FLOSS makes it inherently more insecure
558761774120173607,20,spectre and meltdown
558761796698374151,15,also a new meme
558761869297451020,21,that has no real name
558762970541457448,85,not bad_ but not really the best option when it comes to fully free hardware/software
558763036756934656,72,if you want something that Just Works_ then yeah their laptops are great
558763911843938338,69,I'm pretty sure coreboot can handle quite a few of the "new" chipsets
558763983281324033,44,puri.sm people even contributed some patches
558765227995430922,6,oh yes
558765316147118083,42,mostly due to external funding and support
558765608142110720,31,that's the official source_ yes
