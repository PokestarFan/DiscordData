560981724025061407,1184,After working long_ tiresome hours as a janitor and just watching the local flora and fauna run away with nothing being done_ this mad decides he will help save his town the best he can. There is no seeds left as far as he knows so he gets to inventing and finds out a way to create and bottle oxygen because the townsfolk will die if he doesn't find a way around the lack of plants. Of course this technology is incredibly expensive and so he sadly has to charge for the oxygen his machines create. He works hard_ supplies the citizens with air and rightfully earns his spot as their mayor. He build roads and artificial and ingenius plant-substitutes in order to bring beauty to the town. He builds a wall in order to hide the horrible outside world in order that his citizens may only know joy. One day a young boy_ let's call him Ed wants to do away with all the oxygen in order to grow a single seed he found. Now our protagonist realized plants need oxygen to make sugars but the young boy wants to immediately shut down the plants. When our hero says that the plant would be better off dead than in a world without oxygen_ his loyal deliveryman betrays him. Who is the villain?
