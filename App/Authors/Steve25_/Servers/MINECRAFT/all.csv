558825543257030656,technical-bedrock,120,It says something about a websocket server like /wsserver but I've only seen one youtube video explaining what that does
558826020426481695,technical-bedrock,108,Unfortunatly_ No not unless you join a world that has a resource pack enabled that changes the textures back
558826063829008384,technical-bedrock,63,But a new legacy texture pack might come out on the marketplace
558826158544781333,technical-bedrock,64,My question from *Today at 9:32 PM* still wasn't answered though
558826727904903173,technical-bedrock,105,Well_ This is not what I was looking for at all_ For some reason I don't see anything about this command.
558827777533411335,technical-bedrock,294,How do I use /videostream and /videostreamaction on minecraft bedrock editon?NL**It does exist** don't try messing with me please_ I just want an answer_ I saw it in the list of commands I can auto-complete using tab but I do not know how to use it but I can only guess what it does by the name.

558849071855435777,minecraft,34,someone posted it a good while ago
558849178500071451,minecraft,1197,The Minecraft world was a bustling place of civilizations. Villagers ruled the lands. They had temples built to their gods_ they built ships to travel the world_ and they lived a peaceful life_ mining_ farming_ and other things.NLNLThey had a nice life_ until one of them discovered something that their ancient ancestors left. The stronghold with a portal to a dimension_ called the End. NLNLPeople activated the End Portal_ and some were able to go live in the End dimension (How we have End cities and end ships). NLNLOthers were killed and turned into the Endermen which were controlled by the mighty dragon_ the evil of the world.NLNLThe dimension Hell was discovered when a person was messing with fire in the depths of a mine. Villagers went to explore_ and were killed by the demons of Hell.NLNLA war raged between Hell and the Villagers_ which then caused all of the hostile mobs to exist_ and for villages to be so isolated. NLNLTemples fell into ruin_ ships fought and sunk_ mines fell into disuse_ and soon the whole world was overgrown and forgotten.NLNLHow we find this world_ is we wake up from a coma in the middle of nowhere_ after everything has happened.NLNLThe portals fell apart_ and etc etc.
560636202818994206,builds,244,Building a castle_ I have walls as big as a 0/4 map on bedrock_ Not sure if it's different bedrock to java but I'm doing this on bedrock.NLDoes anyone have ideas for rooms that I should add? I'm already going to add storage rooms and a treasury.
