558829038802698243,debates,21,they look better blue
558829130867802113,debates,78,white peacocks seem pointless to meNLsame with silver and dilute lady gouldians
558829234366185503,debates,80,like why would you breed something known for its bright colors to be plain white
558829385776365570,debates,67,except turkeys they do that so feather quills don't show up as much
558829464705040411,debates,13,oversaturated
558829504219578370,debates,17,but real probably

558859073915846679,serious-personal,9,Congrats!
558859210964729857,serious-personal,2,aw
558859372210552860,serious-personal,12,that is good
558859430234685450,serious-personal,23,I want to be happy more
558859476791197699,serious-personal,16,but I don't know
558859525797445635,serious-personal,25,but that's life I suppose
558859577274400770,serious-personal,51,being clueless and figuring stuff out along the way
558860719890628609,serious-personal,362,Idk just moving to college has made me a bit nostalgic NLlike I thought a "blank slate" would mean the opportunity to do betterNLI am improvingNLbut I am still me and have to put up with screwing upNLNLIt feels like I didn't have as much worry or as much care when I was a kidNLI'm a better person now I'd say_ but it still feels like I've lost part of what made me me
558861489327308819,serious-personal,109,I've become a lot more pessimisticNLI was always a bit on that side_ but didn't overly concern myself about it
558861504720404510,serious-personal,4,true
558861642171940875,serious-personal,89,I've made some mistakes recently that shouldn't have been madeNLI knew something was wrong
558861660111241216,serious-personal,3,hmm
558861870623227914,serious-personal,128,idk sometimes it feels like I'm focusing myself more on what could go wrong in the future over what's going right in the present
558861878739206144,serious-personal,4,true
558861950231248909,serious-personal,52,but there are some mistakes that there is no redoing
558862078689935390,serious-personal,4,what
558863095603134475,serious-personal,448,my bird died a painful death because I misplaced a few hundred dollars and then didn't kill her when it was too bad for recoveryNLI relocated the money so it shouldn't happen again but what's done is doneNLI am capable of quickly killing things to put them out of their misery (had to do that to a tiny  lizard I found with its guts spilling out that would not have made it) but couldn't give the same merciful death to my own petNLnatural death sucks
558863287383490571,serious-personal,110,other stuff like screwing up a project or annoying a friend or saying the wrong thing to someone I can correct
558863319721705472,serious-personal,16,but this is done
558863332963123220,serious-personal,3,vet
558863568980672546,serious-personal,147,I had been sticking money into a savings account and didn't realize that it was same account as parents' that they used for my school/grocery stuff
558863644285206531,serious-personal,53,and oh my out of sight out of mind is too true for me
558863807804473346,serious-personal,110,it didn't occur to me that the money I set aside actually existed until my parents told me how much I saved up
558863905397407744,serious-personal,32,which was about 10 days too late
558864030979194920,serious-personal,12,yeah I don't
558864126622040065,serious-personal,89,it's just the stuff that was my responsibility that actually mattered that is the problem
558864322479128587,serious-personal,53,everyone's got their regrets if they live long enough
558864520425242644,serious-personal,4,yeah
558864594756567062,serious-personal,39,it just feels like I'm not doing enough
558864672502054942,serious-personal,37,like better than most in some regards
558864719914467348,serious-personal,27,bottom line is I need a job
558864841734094869,serious-personal,83,and I'll be a legal adult soon so I can do some of that online stuff for side money
558864880086679553,serious-personal,30,then if anything else comes up
558864920226037771,serious-personal,32,thinking rev.com for side income
558864946243436544,serious-personal,5,maybe
558864993160790017,serious-personal,38,think that's the transcription service
558865064652963850,serious-personal,52,got an internship for summer that pays a bit perhaps
558865270471393280,serious-personal,10,I think so
558865383604355092,serious-personal,122,like my schedule is full-time school_ but honestly I could work 20-30 hours/week probably and come out fine if a bit tired
558865452193808414,serious-personal,4,yeah
558865480098643998,serious-personal,14,it's at a ranh
558865501267296257,serious-personal,6,*ranch
558865548968984599,serious-personal,2,XD
558865622516105216,serious-personal,12,I do hope so
558865658998161408,serious-personal,30,I'm majoring in animal science
558865727248007199,serious-personal,52,but even then I'm not really sure what I'll be doing
558865755915943956,serious-personal,4,yeah
558865913013600268,serious-personal,18,that would be good
558865919158517761,serious-personal,54,I got to watch them file horse teeth NLit was a bit odd
558866064684089365,serious-personal,93,it's like I don't want to be a vet because an extra 5 years of school plus loans sounds awful
558866256640475156,serious-personal,122,but I don't want to do anything with poultry_ and am not particularly happy with certain parts of swine and dairy industry
558866342015664149,serious-personal,71,beef cattle seem fine but still not what I'd probably want to do as job
558866444021006367,serious-personal,49,I think I could be okay as a vet if I was trained
558866517547155477,serious-personal,45,but I feel I'm more suited for something else
558866618554384384,serious-personal,3,huh
558866722023669761,serious-personal,60,I've heard of the "unplugging" movement I think they call it
558866882409529365,serious-personal,50,where you farm all day and live with little impact
558866932619542548,serious-personal,38,like I think there's still electricity
558867015968882708,serious-personal,59,but it's about minimizing ecological footprint or something
558867182428225563,serious-personal,88,I want to travel around the US_ maybe in a camperNLbut with that comes an unstable career

558868801370980353,serious-personal,15,like 5-10 years
558869019713863687,serious-personal,45,but if super detailed then maybe a few months
558869100164546566,serious-personal,9,I do that
558869231303786508,serious-personal,73,I used to have to plan what to say before I said it so I knew what to say
558869291819335682,serious-personal,56,like guessing how they'd respond and addressing that too
558869361952292875,serious-personal,45,and then guessing all their responses to that
558869379891068930,serious-personal,11,etc etc etc
558869479480885261,serious-personal,25,have like 10 backup plans
558869587584614400,serious-personal,60,get annoyed/concerned when they don't act according to plan?
558869786575241226,serious-personal,2,ah
558869923141779456,serious-personal,100,I usually do the talking in my head but sometimes I mutter or grin to myself and people are confused

558870461417521152,serious-personal,28,oh no I forgot to eat dinner
558870542703263744,serious-personal,47,and this is why I'm doing a reverse freshman 15
558870561233567747,serious-personal,8,I should
558870655878168577,serious-personal,57,but it's so late it would probably keep me up for a while
558870708118224906,serious-personal,35,it takes me excessively long to eat
558870874053410837,serious-personal,28,idk they're both pretty good

558872309725659168,server-feedback,116,A channel for people's hobbies would be good. Art would probably have to be separate since there are so many artists
559097774575190057,serious-personal-2,22,we all have those days
559098370275147796,serious-personal-2,188,just sometimes we don't talk about it in personNLpeople are trying to put their best face forward because they don't want people judgingNLeven though a lot of the times people aren't judging
559098635971985418,serious-personal-2,64,that's why I tend to be more open about stuff under my pseudonym
559098827660066816,serious-personal-2,32,like I feel I can be more honest
559098874401128468,serious-personal-2,36,otherwise I tend to lie via omission
