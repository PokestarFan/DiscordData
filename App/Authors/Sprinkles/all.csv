558427442776375317,MINECRAFT,minecraft,43,Could you do anything at all to prevent it?
558427558643761183,MINECRAFT,minecraft,92,I don't think such a destructive thing that happens by purely random cahnce should be added.
558427973997297675,MINECRAFT,minecraft,223,*This is a game.*NLWe can decide what does and doesn't go inside it_ unlike real life. I'd stop playing in newer versions if they added such things because it wouldn't be fun to suddenly lose everything due to random chance.
558428189471408140,MINECRAFT,minecraft,162,Everything that's destructive in the game is the player's fault_ except lightning. You need to have done something to cause it_ such as letting a creeper explode.
558428365351026718,MINECRAFT,minecraft,119,There's lots of ideas to add. A cool volcanic landscape with __inactive__ volcanoes would be an amazing place to visit.

558429144384405533,MINECRAFT,minecraft,143,😄 These are only a few ideas I just came up with on the spot. Anything I'd like to see in the game you can't even see unless you looked for it.

558429784443584515,MINECRAFT,minecraft,81,add-ons could have more to them_ yeah_ but it's some of the best BE has as of now
558429940140474368,MINECRAFT,minecraft,48,I'm sure scripting ≠ modding unless I'm mistaken

558435713385889804,MINECRAFT,technical-java,515,Let me check if I got an objective name right_ but otherwise here's my response:NLNLI could directly convert these commands into their 1.13+ form.NL```/scoreboard players add @p[scores={vex=1..}] money 2NL/scoreboard players remove @p[scores={vex=1..}] vex 1```NL```/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=10000..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:"minecraft:villager"}}NL/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=10000..}] money 10000```NL```/scoreboard objectives add creeper killed:creeper creeper```
558437319430897693,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,170,Depending on the circumstance_ you can prevent mobs from attacking players so they can't inflict damage. Zombies with weakness shouldn't be able to knock the player back.
558437902833549322,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,15,You're welcome!
558438631715504153,MINECRAFT,technical-java,7,Yessir!
558439122482757642,MINECRAFT,technical-java,226,The old system was inefficient_ outdated_ and crude with lots of useless commands. This updated system has a new parser_ completely rewritten commands and storage_ and merged useless commands into others so they became useful.
558439451752267806,MINECRAFT,technical-java,84,I have_ yeah. Scores use ranges instead of "at least <number>" or "at most <number>"
558439501634994177,MINECRAFT,technical-java,234,If I wanted to store the number of items I have in my hand to a score_ I'd runNL`/execute as @p store result score @s itemCount run data get entity @s SelectedItem`NLWe can do so much more thanks to the changes in the commands from 1.13
558439905429159946,MINECRAFT,technical-java,47,I assume you mean running a command constantly?
558440298146037766,MINECRAFT,technical-java,196,Redstone and commands don't mix well these days_ but some people use them still. Repeating command blocks run their commands twenty times per second_ if you need commands to be running that often.
558441131340333086,MINECRAFT,technical-java,138,You can use a repeating command block for the first_ and point that into an always active chain command block. They will execute together.
558441591484710958,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,335,You can do that_ *thankfully* MCBE at least has dummy objectives. You can increase an entity's score (not sure if fake players exist) and execute if it hits a certain value. If a score increments 20 times per second_ you'd want to multiply the time in seconds you want to wait by twenty.NL`60 seconds * 20 ticks-per-second = 1200 ticks`
558441961359540249,MINECRAFT,technical-java,110,Ah_ that's a JSON component. For simplicity's sake_ you can shorten that to `"creeper`" with quotes around it.
558442120705212467,MINECRAFT,technical-java,95,And no_ command blocks can be in essentially any rotation as long as they point into each other
558442466517319702,MINECRAFT,technical-java,59,Yep. if you did it the other way around_ it might not work.
558442590601609229,MINECRAFT,technical-java,4,Yes.
558442974976016384,MINECRAFT,technical-java,12,It can_ yes.
558443156950220810,MINECRAFT,technical-java,39,They're rotational_ similar to pistons.
558444115394560001,MINECRAFT,technical-java,4,Huh?
558444400838049817,MINECRAFT,technical-java,49,It's not working now? What were you using before?
558444864002588682,MINECRAFT,technical-java,186,`Dollar`'s not a valid objective. If you're looking for an objective that doesn't change until you tell it to_ you would use `dummy`.NL```/scoreboard objectives add money dummy "Dollar"``
558445065337307137,MINECRAFT,technical-java,30,Yeah. That part hasn't changed
558445997236420629,MINECRAFT,technical-java,117,Is `zombie` a valid objective? If so_ make sure your score's increasing. Otherwise I'm not sure why it's not working.
558446716953821207,MINECRAFT,technical-java,13,Good to hear!
558447752615428106,MINECRAFT,technical-java,79,I'd say the actual name of the file_ but the moderation bot tends to delete it.
558447962762641413,MINECRAFT,technical-java,39,It's in the server(dot)properties file.
558448095550242837,MINECRAFT,technical-java,70,Until I memorized JSON_ I used this site: <https://minecraftjson.com/>
558448398303232011,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,28,Unfortunately not_ it seems.
558448674645213184,MINECRAFT,technical-java,91,You click the Add Text button_ then insert some text at the top_ then click Add Text again.
558448808577466411,MINECRAFT,technical-java,47,Although... it seems this isn't updated either.
558448930493562910,MINECRAFT,technical-java,246,lol this was the `/give` command it gave me:NL```/give @p sign 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"[\"\"_{\"text\":\"asd\"}]"_id:"Sign"}}```NLWhen it should look like this:NL```/give @p sign{BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"[\"\"_{\"text\":\"asd\"}]"_id:"Sign"}} 1```
558449115596324891,MINECRAFT,technical-java,97,It's especially wrong in 1.14_ as oak/spruce/etc. types of signs exist. So it's a little outdated
558449307166965762,MINECRAFT,technical-java,128,You use backticks. It's good for ignoring discord's formatting.NL\`small block\`: `example`NL\`\`\`code block\`\`\`:NL```example```

558449525099069450,MINECRAFT,technical-java,37,A sign that... does those things? hmm
558449976129355776,MINECRAFT,technical-java,143,The issue with having commands like that on a sign is players will need operator permissions to run certain commands like `/give` or `/gamemode
558450032387555328,MINECRAFT,technical-java,21,You could_ sure [Lit]
558450309395906560,MINECRAFT,technical-java,204,If you want players to be able to interact with things on signs with click events like that_ you could set up a trigger objective with the `/trigger` command instead. That's what that command was made for
558451225188892674,MINECRAFT,technical-java,618,Trigger objectives are scoreboards that anyone can modify for themselves. They need to be activated first to change them_ and deactivate when modified.NLYou could have a sign with a click event to run a `/trigger` command that changes a trigger scoreboard_ and check if a player's score changes.NLNLLet's pretend we have a trigger objective called "test". In the sign you got your click event that has this: `/trigger test`NLThe command succeeds_ then you check for the score change in another command block: `execute as @a if score @s test matches 1.. run <command>`NLIt's rather hard to explain_ but that's the basic idea
558451702160949248,MINECRAFT,technical-java,93,They must have had some kind of permission to use them. Or there was some mod magic happening
558451749577293844,MINECRAFT,technical-java,53,Non-operator players shouldn't have access to `/give`
558453497776046120,MINECRAFT,technical-java,540,Most of that is the same_ just changing this:NL```jsonNL/give @p oak_sign{BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"color\":\"blue\"}"_Text2:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:\\\"minecraft:villager\\\"}}\"}}"_Text3:"{\"text\":\"$ 5_- \"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] money 5\"}}"}_display:{Name:"Custom Sign"}}```
558453559985963029,MINECRAFT,technical-java,50,Oh_ I'm in 1.14 so `oak_sign` might not exist yet.
