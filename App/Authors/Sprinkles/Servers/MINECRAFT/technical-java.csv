558435569999413251,23,Will this be for 1.13+?
558435713385889804,515,Let me check if I got an objective name right_ but otherwise here's my response:NLNLI could directly convert these commands into their 1.13+ form.NL```/scoreboard players add @p[scores={vex=1..}] money 2NL/scoreboard players remove @p[scores={vex=1..}] vex 1```NL```/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=10000..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:"minecraft:villager"}}NL/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=10000..}] money 10000```NL```/scoreboard objectives add creeper killed:creeper creeper```
558438631715504153,7,Yessir!
558439122482757642,226,The old system was inefficient_ outdated_ and crude with lots of useless commands. This updated system has a new parser_ completely rewritten commands and storage_ and merged useless commands into others so they became useful.
558439451752267806,84,I have_ yeah. Scores use ranges instead of "at least <number>" or "at most <number>"
558439501634994177,234,If I wanted to store the number of items I have in my hand to a score_ I'd runNL`/execute as @p store result score @s itemCount run data get entity @s SelectedItem`NLWe can do so much more thanks to the changes in the commands from 1.13
558439905429159946,47,I assume you mean running a command constantly?
558440298146037766,196,Redstone and commands don't mix well these days_ but some people use them still. Repeating command blocks run their commands twenty times per second_ if you need commands to be running that often.
558441131340333086,138,You can use a repeating command block for the first_ and point that into an always active chain command block. They will execute together.
558441961359540249,110,Ah_ that's a JSON component. For simplicity's sake_ you can shorten that to `"creeper`" with quotes around it.
558442120705212467,95,And no_ command blocks can be in essentially any rotation as long as they point into each other
558442466517319702,59,Yep. if you did it the other way around_ it might not work.
558442590601609229,4,Yes.
558442974976016384,12,It can_ yes.
558443156950220810,39,They're rotational_ similar to pistons.
558444115394560001,4,Huh?
558444400838049817,49,It's not working now? What were you using before?
558444864002588682,186,`Dollar`'s not a valid objective. If you're looking for an objective that doesn't change until you tell it to_ you would use `dummy`.NL```/scoreboard objectives add money dummy "Dollar"``
558445065337307137,30,Yeah. That part hasn't changed
558445997236420629,117,Is `zombie` a valid objective? If so_ make sure your score's increasing. Otherwise I'm not sure why it's not working.
558446716953821207,13,Good to hear!
558447752615428106,79,I'd say the actual name of the file_ but the moderation bot tends to delete it.
558447962762641413,39,It's in the server(dot)properties file.
558448095550242837,70,Until I memorized JSON_ I used this site: <https://minecraftjson.com/>
558448674645213184,91,You click the Add Text button_ then insert some text at the top_ then click Add Text again.
558448808577466411,47,Although... it seems this isn't updated either.
558448930493562910,246,lol this was the `/give` command it gave me:NL```/give @p sign 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"[\"\"_{\"text\":\"asd\"}]"_id:"Sign"}}```NLWhen it should look like this:NL```/give @p sign{BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"[\"\"_{\"text\":\"asd\"}]"_id:"Sign"}} 1```
558449115596324891,97,It's especially wrong in 1.14_ as oak/spruce/etc. types of signs exist. So it's a little outdated
558449307166965762,128,You use backticks. It's good for ignoring discord's formatting.NL\`small block\`: `example`NL\`\`\`code block\`\`\`:NL```example```
558449430387228682,69,It also supports syntax highlighting.NL```jsonNL{NL    "example": 1NL}```
558449525099069450,37,A sign that... does those things? hmm
558449976129355776,143,The issue with having commands like that on a sign is players will need operator permissions to run certain commands like `/give` or `/gamemode
558450032387555328,21,You could_ sure [Lit]
558450309395906560,204,If you want players to be able to interact with things on signs with click events like that_ you could set up a trigger objective with the `/trigger` command instead. That's what that command was made for
558451225188892674,618,Trigger objectives are scoreboards that anyone can modify for themselves. They need to be activated first to change them_ and deactivate when modified.NLYou could have a sign with a click event to run a `/trigger` command that changes a trigger scoreboard_ and check if a player's score changes.NLNLLet's pretend we have a trigger objective called "test". In the sign you got your click event that has this: `/trigger test`NLThe command succeeds_ then you check for the score change in another command block: `execute as @a if score @s test matches 1.. run <command>`NLIt's rather hard to explain_ but that's the basic idea
558451702160949248,93,They must have had some kind of permission to use them. Or there was some mod magic happening
558451749577293844,53,Non-operator players shouldn't have access to `/give`
558453497776046120,540,Most of that is the same_ just changing this:NL```jsonNL/give @p oak_sign{BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"color\":\"blue\"}"_Text2:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:\\\"minecraft:villager\\\"}}\"}}"_Text3:"{\"text\":\"$ 5_- \"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] money 5\"}}"}_display:{Name:"Custom Sign"}}```
558453559985963029,50,Oh_ I'm in 1.14 so `oak_sign` might not exist yet.
558454606317748224,483,```jsonNL/give @p oak_sign{BlockEntityTag:{Text1:""_Text2:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:\\\"minecraft:villager\\\"}}\"}}"_Text3:"{\"text\":\"$ 5_- \"_\"color\":\"green\"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] money 5\"}}"}_display:{Name:"\"Custom Sign\""}}```NLLike that?
558455776159727646,147,Two different colors... it's a little tricky.NL```jsonNL"[\"\"_{\"text\":\"Red\"_\"color\":\"red\"}_\" \"_{\"text\":\"Blue\"_\"color\":\"blue\"}]"```
558457113081413632,40,Worked for me. What command did you use?
558458192280158228,201,`Text3:""[\"\"_{\"text\":\"Red\"_\"color\":\"red\"}_\" \"_{\"text\":\"Blue\"_\"color\":\"blue\"}]"_`NLThe error lies in the JSON text being outside the original quotes_ and an extra quote on the outside
558460244364230716,51,`Text3:""[\"`*`<--[HERE]`*NLThe issue still persists
558460323271802880,40,The JSON is outside the quotation string
558460439550492702,130,Should look like this:NL```jsonNLText3:"[\"\"_{\"text\":\"Red\"_\"color\":\"red\"}_\" \"_{\"text\":\"Blue\"_\"color\":\"blue\"}]"```
558463619998941224,38,That should work. Encountering issues?
558464081485496331,45,What does the error say in the command block?
558464902642270218,328,``blue\"}]"_\"clickEvent\"``NLThe issue is the clickevent is outside the component.NL```jsonNLText3:"[\"\"_{\"text\":\"Red\"_\"color\":\"red\"}_\" \"_{\"text\":\"Blue\"_\"color\":\"blue\"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] money 5\"}}]"```NLtry that
558466327933616128,173,Almost. There should be a right square bracket `}` after that last part_ at:NL...`money 5\"}}]"_display`...NLbetween the quotation mark and the comma. `money 5\"}}]"}_display`
558466420988575775,60,As the `display` tag isn't apart of the `BlockEntityTag` tag
558468653029523457,57,If they have operator permissions_ anyone can use it yeah
558468805508988939,53,Basically. You'd need to use a `/trigger` click event
558469142060072960,62,Non-op'd players don't have access to `/scoreboard` or `/give`
558469873806737408,73,I'm not sure if I will be up when you contact me_ but you can if you wish
558472463587999762,98,it's an official partnered server (or the owner is a discord partner) so they get a custom invite.
558472556198494209,88,The owner of the Terraria server's a discord partner_ and they have a custom invite too.
558472811572625431,109,Maybe? I know for sure it has to do with the Discord Partner thing_ but maybe verified servers get those too.
558472912886300672,26,A verification symbol? no.
558473134777303100,82,That I'm not sure of. Some discord members are Discord Partners_ not many of them.
558800664667619339,429,<@517443822578302977> Steps:NL1. Boot up the latest snapshotNL2. Navigate to your minecraft directory. `%appdata% > .minecraft > versions > 19w12b > 19w12b.jar`NL3.

558801589662515215,116,It's a snapshot version_ you can enable snapshots in the launcher. (I'm trying to remember exactly how to enable it)
