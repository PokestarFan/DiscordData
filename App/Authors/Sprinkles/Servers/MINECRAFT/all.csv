558427558643761183,minecraft,92,I don't think such a destructive thing that happens by purely random cahnce should be added.
558427973997297675,minecraft,223,*This is a game.*NLWe can decide what does and doesn't go inside it_ unlike real life. I'd stop playing in newer versions if they added such things because it wouldn't be fun to suddenly lose everything due to random chance.
558428189471408140,minecraft,162,Everything that's destructive in the game is the player's fault_ except lightning. You need to have done something to cause it_ such as letting a creeper explode.
558428365351026718,minecraft,119,There's lots of ideas to add. A cool volcanic landscape with __inactive__ volcanoes would be an amazing place to visit.

558429784443584515,minecraft,81,add-ons could have more to them_ yeah_ but it's some of the best BE has as of now
558429940140474368,minecraft,48,I'm sure scripting ≠ modding unless I'm mistaken
558435569999413251,technical-java,23,Will this be for 1.13+?
558435713385889804,technical-java,515,Let me check if I got an objective name right_ but otherwise here's my response:NLNLI could directly convert these commands into their 1.13+ form.NL```/scoreboard players add @p[scores={vex=1..}] money 2NL/scoreboard players remove @p[scores={vex=1..}] vex 1```NL```/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=10000..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:"minecraft:villager"}}NL/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=10000..}] money 10000```NL```/scoreboard objectives add creeper killed:creeper creeper```
558437319430897693,technical-bedrock,170,Depending on the circumstance_ you can prevent mobs from attacking players so they can't inflict damage. Zombies with weakness shouldn't be able to knock the player back.
558437902833549322,technical-bedrock,15,You're welcome!
558438631715504153,technical-java,7,Yessir!
558439122482757642,technical-java,226,The old system was inefficient_ outdated_ and crude with lots of useless commands. This updated system has a new parser_ completely rewritten commands and storage_ and merged useless commands into others so they became useful.
558439451752267806,technical-java,84,I have_ yeah. Scores use ranges instead of "at least <number>" or "at most <number>"
558439501634994177,technical-java,234,If I wanted to store the number of items I have in my hand to a score_ I'd runNL`/execute as @p store result score @s itemCount run data get entity @s SelectedItem`NLWe can do so much more thanks to the changes in the commands from 1.13
558439905429159946,technical-java,47,I assume you mean running a command constantly?
558440298146037766,technical-java,196,Redstone and commands don't mix well these days_ but some people use them still. Repeating command blocks run their commands twenty times per second_ if you need commands to be running that often.
558441131340333086,technical-java,138,You can use a repeating command block for the first_ and point that into an always active chain command block. They will execute together.
558441591484710958,technical-bedrock,335,You can do that_ *thankfully* MCBE at least has dummy objectives. You can increase an entity's score (not sure if fake players exist) and execute if it hits a certain value. If a score increments 20 times per second_ you'd want to multiply the time in seconds you want to wait by twenty.NL`60 seconds * 20 ticks-per-second = 1200 ticks`
558441961359540249,technical-java,110,Ah_ that's a JSON component. For simplicity's sake_ you can shorten that to `"creeper`" with quotes around it.
558442120705212467,technical-java,95,And no_ command blocks can be in essentially any rotation as long as they point into each other
558442466517319702,technical-java,59,Yep. if you did it the other way around_ it might not work.
558442590601609229,technical-java,4,Yes.
558442974976016384,technical-java,12,It can_ yes.
558443156950220810,technical-java,39,They're rotational_ similar to pistons.
558444115394560001,technical-java,4,Huh?
558444400838049817,technical-java,49,It's not working now? What were you using before?
558444864002588682,technical-java,186,`Dollar`'s not a valid objective. If you're looking for an objective that doesn't change until you tell it to_ you would use `dummy`.NL```/scoreboard objectives add money dummy "Dollar"``
558445065337307137,technical-java,30,Yeah. That part hasn't changed
558445997236420629,technical-java,117,Is `zombie` a valid objective? If so_ make sure your score's increasing. Otherwise I'm not sure why it's not working.
558446716953821207,technical-java,13,Good to hear!
558447752615428106,technical-java,79,I'd say the actual name of the file_ but the moderation bot tends to delete it.
558447962762641413,technical-java,39,It's in the server(dot)properties file.
558448095550242837,technical-java,70,Until I memorized JSON_ I used this site: <https://minecraftjson.com/>
558448398303232011,technical-bedrock,28,Unfortunately not_ it seems.

558448808577466411,technical-java,47,Although... it seems this isn't updated either.
558448930493562910,technical-java,246,lol this was the `/give` command it gave me:NL```/give @p sign 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"[\"\"_{\"text\":\"asd\"}]"_id:"Sign"}}```NLWhen it should look like this:NL```/give @p sign{BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"[\"\"_{\"text\":\"asd\"}]"_id:"Sign"}} 1```
558449115596324891,technical-java,97,It's especially wrong in 1.14_ as oak/spruce/etc. types of signs exist. So it's a little outdated
558449307166965762,technical-java,128,You use backticks. It's good for ignoring discord's formatting.NL\`small block\`: `example`NL\`\`\`code block\`\`\`:NL```example```
558449430387228682,technical-java,69,It also supports syntax highlighting.NL```jsonNL{NL    "example": 1NL}```
558449525099069450,technical-java,37,A sign that... does those things? hmm
558449976129355776,technical-java,143,The issue with having commands like that on a sign is players will need operator permissions to run certain commands like `/give` or `/gamemode
558450032387555328,technical-java,21,You could_ sure [Lit]
558450309395906560,technical-java,204,If you want players to be able to interact with things on signs with click events like that_ you could set up a trigger objective with the `/trigger` command instead. That's what that command was made for
558451225188892674,technical-java,618,Trigger objectives are scoreboards that anyone can modify for themselves. They need to be activated first to change them_ and deactivate when modified.NLYou could have a sign with a click event to run a `/trigger` command that changes a trigger scoreboard_ and check if a player's score changes.NLNLLet's pretend we have a trigger objective called "test". In the sign you got your click event that has this: `/trigger test`NLThe command succeeds_ then you check for the score change in another command block: `execute as @a if score @s test matches 1.. run <command>`NLIt's rather hard to explain_ but that's the basic idea
558451702160949248,technical-java,93,They must have had some kind of permission to use them. Or there was some mod magic happening
558451749577293844,technical-java,53,Non-operator players shouldn't have access to `/give`
558453497776046120,technical-java,540,Most of that is the same_ just changing this:NL```jsonNL/give @p oak_sign{BlockEntityTag:{Text1:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"color\":\"blue\"}"_Text2:"{\"text\":\"Villager Egg\"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/give @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] minecraft:ghast_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:\\\"minecraft:villager\\\"}}\"}}"_Text3:"{\"text\":\"$ 5_- \"_\"clickEvent\":{\"action\":\"run_command\"_\"value\":\"/scoreboard players remove @p[distance=..3_scores={money=5..}] money 5\"}}"}_display:{Name:"Custom Sign"}}```
558453559985963029,technical-java,50,Oh_ I'm in 1.14 so `oak_sign` might not exist yet.

560639642181959710,technical-java,40,Armor stand entities is a bit... finicky
560640046596882432,technical-java,65,Ah_ that's a tricky problem. Glad you got it figured out quickly!

560640560789192714,technical-java,18,Aye. Good to hear!
