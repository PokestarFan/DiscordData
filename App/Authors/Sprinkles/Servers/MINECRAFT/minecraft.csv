558427417568346123,58,What if a meteor fell from the sky_ right onto your house?
558427442776375317,43,Could you do anything at all to prevent it?
558427558643761183,92,I don't think such a destructive thing that happens by purely random cahnce should be added.
558427973997297675,223,*This is a game.*NLWe can decide what does and doesn't go inside it_ unlike real life. I'd stop playing in newer versions if they added such things because it wouldn't be fun to suddenly lose everything due to random chance.
558428189471408140,162,Everything that's destructive in the game is the player's fault_ except lightning. You need to have done something to cause it_ such as letting a creeper explode.
558428365351026718,119,There's lots of ideas to add. A cool volcanic landscape with __inactive__ volcanoes would be an amazing place to visit.
558428568850530306,31,There are already sea biomes...

558428748991561740,62,Well_ like it or not_ but those are an example of ocean biomes
558428916260405285,58,A new igneous rock material for building would be awesome.
558429144384405533,143,ðŸ˜„ These are only a few ideas I just came up with on the spot. Anything I'd like to see in the game you can't even see unless you looked for it.
558429571343581186,5,?t hi
558429784443584515,81,add-ons could have more to them_ yeah_ but it's some of the best BE has as of now

558797345421131786,5,i am!
558797429189771264,47,`/data modify` and CustomModelData are amazing.
558797919751241728,10,Yes hello!
558798087330594826,71,Eh_ I'm not in a situation to VC right now_ and I don't VC much anyway.
558798569318907904,52,Pocket hasn't been around that long_ though.NLHas it?
558798672473620490,33,I thought it was around 2013-2014
558798860131237898,67,<@382367334347571210> Sorry to hear. Are you referring to MCBE1.10?
558798953236267008,45,I've had some issues with 1.10_ not sure why.
558799300738547722,122,Some of the new textures are hideous_ yeah. But overall I personally think they're an improvement. Some just need tweaked.
558799366173884416,61,Golden swords are an example of one. They're so contrasted...
558799429432377384,46,<@314635497551167490> Whacky_ I'm wrong. Neat!
558799843968155648,80,The Java and Bedrock editions will come bundled with the old textures available.
558802599105527809,74,Despite MCBE selling far better. *I blame the number of platforms it's on*
558802730085515295,64,<@282716043867062272> haha_ near parity will likely never happen
