558780217796329473,2,me
558780284729032704,10,thanks UwU
558780342434136113,49,part of my ideology is to turn all men into girls
558784385181286410,34,tbh its how stuff is phrased often
558784415774539796,40,many questions are phrased kinda weirdly
558784433768103946,30,or incredibly america specific
558784459944755220,48,or nonsensical like we must establish a monarchy
558787475611451394,20,they look like girls
558787558931300418,29,yeah but they look like girls
558787637780152323,0,
558787654590791700,40,does this look like a fucking man to you
558787662446592011,16,are you retarded
558787717417271307,66,tbh "are traps gay" is actually an unironcially interesting debate
558787740259581965,43,since it is what you believe vs what you do
558787797792718848,89,the belief is that you are fucking a girl_ and you are attracted based on it being a girl
558787847000424470,75,but having sex and doing with them is objectively a gay act since its 2 men
558787892722270262,43,unionically there is a debate to be had ngl
558788026327629844,50,Im sayin gits not gay becuase they look like girls
558788083496124416,26,that is not how traps work
558788128312393739,55,the point of a trap is that you are attracted to a girl
558788138265215006,30,who then turns out to be a man
558788154774126604,24,which makes you feel gay
558788162084798469,17,that's the appeal
558788174248280076,25,it's a humiliation fetish
558788207584739358,5,it is
558788216610619392,20,you get humilitiated
558788230271598595,21,thats the whole thing

"Technological advancements_ instead of benefiting workers_ result in decreased or stagnant wages_ worsening bargaining power_ or mass layoffs.

It shows that during the 20s and 40s (admittedly_ the 1940s was a war_ so that one is guaranteed to be higher) people worked roughly 48 to 50 hours a week. Starting with 1950 hourly workweeks have decreased_ from 48_1 hours per week in 1950 to 39_7 hours per week in 1990.

559009213049995295,114,The stuff i've found doesn't support these claims_ and actually points to increasing wages at decreasing workhours
559009295187050509,124,All of these sources are in German_ but mostly are statistics and just about the numbers. I can translate anything you want.
559009496316248064,72,If you want more or for the Netherlands or something feel free to to ask
