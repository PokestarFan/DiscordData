558780284729032704,debates,10,thanks UwU
558780342434136113,debates,49,part of my ideology is to turn all men into girls
558784385181286410,debates,34,tbh its how stuff is phrased often
558784415774539796,debates,40,many questions are phrased kinda weirdly
558784433768103946,debates,30,or incredibly america specific
558784459944755220,debates,48,or nonsensical like we must establish a monarchy
558787475611451394,debates,20,they look like girls
558787558931300418,debates,29,yeah but they look like girls

558787654590791700,debates,40,does this look like a fucking man to you
558787662446592011,debates,16,are you retarded
558787717417271307,debates,66,tbh "are traps gay" is actually an unironcially interesting debate
558787740259581965,debates,43,since it is what you believe vs what you do
558787797792718848,debates,89,the belief is that you are fucking a girl_ and you are attracted based on it being a girl
558787847000424470,debates,75,but having sex and doing with them is objectively a gay act since its 2 men
558787892722270262,debates,43,unionically there is a debate to be had ngl
558788026327629844,debates,50,Im sayin gits not gay becuase they look like girls
558788083496124416,debates,26,that is not how traps work
558788128312393739,debates,55,the point of a trap is that you are attracted to a girl
558788138265215006,debates,30,who then turns out to be a man
558788154774126604,debates,24,which makes you feel gay
558788162084798469,debates,17,that's the appeal
558788174248280076,debates,25,it's a humiliation fetish

559005162484531210,debates,480,<@261177081600147457> From your Essay (https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/crash_course_socialism.md) this quote here in the first bit seems inaccurate to me. "Technological advancements_ instead of benefiting workers_ result in decreased or stagnant wages_ worsening bargaining power_ or mass layoffs. For example_ a machine that replaces 10 workers leads to their firing_ resulting in a benefit for the machine owner_ and an economic hardship to the fired workers."
