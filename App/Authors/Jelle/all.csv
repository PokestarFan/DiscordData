558780284729032704,r/teenagers,debates,10,thanks UwU
558780342434136113,r/teenagers,debates,49,part of my ideology is to turn all men into girls
558784385181286410,r/teenagers,debates,34,tbh its how stuff is phrased often
558784415774539796,r/teenagers,debates,40,many questions are phrased kinda weirdly
558784433768103946,r/teenagers,debates,30,or incredibly america specific
558784459944755220,r/teenagers,debates,48,or nonsensical like we must establish a monarchy
558787475611451394,r/teenagers,debates,20,they look like girls
558787558931300418,r/teenagers,debates,29,yeah but they look like girls

558787654590791700,r/teenagers,debates,40,does this look like a fucking man to you
558787662446592011,r/teenagers,debates,16,are you retarded
558787717417271307,r/teenagers,debates,66,tbh "are traps gay" is actually an unironcially interesting debate
558787740259581965,r/teenagers,debates,43,since it is what you believe vs what you do
558787797792718848,r/teenagers,debates,89,the belief is that you are fucking a girl_ and you are attracted based on it being a girl
558787847000424470,r/teenagers,debates,75,but having sex and doing with them is objectively a gay act since its 2 men
558787892722270262,r/teenagers,debates,43,unionically there is a debate to be had ngl
558788026327629844,r/teenagers,debates,50,Im sayin gits not gay becuase they look like girls

558788128312393739,r/teenagers,debates,55,the point of a trap is that you are attracted to a girl
558788138265215006,r/teenagers,debates,30,who then turns out to be a man
558788154774126604,r/teenagers,debates,24,which makes you feel gay
558788162084798469,r/teenagers,debates,17,that's the appeal
558788174248280076,r/teenagers,debates,25,it's a humiliation fetish

559005162484531210,r/teenagers,debates,480,<@261177081600147457> From your Essay (https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/crash_course_socialism.md) this quote here in the first bit seems inaccurate to me. "Technological advancements_ instead of benefiting workers_ result in decreased or stagnant wages_ worsening bargaining power_ or mass layoffs. For example_ a machine that replaces 10 workers leads to their firing_ resulting in a benefit for the machine owner_ and an economic hardship to the fired workers."
