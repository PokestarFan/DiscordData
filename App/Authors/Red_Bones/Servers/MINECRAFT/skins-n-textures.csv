558833484303695885,20,i can go either way!
558833610623549463,45,<@537731814601785346>  create a loarger model
558833844791541773,40,retexture the texture in a resource pack
558834381310132234,136,you can get a editor like gimp and redo the texture in a higher resolution (meaning make the texture 256x256 and scale it in the model )
558834689578631193,103,I would not stretch the texture to try higher resolution_ it will not turn out right and look like crap
558834788795023370,46,you have to edit the texture_ no way around it
558834845325852672,4,yeah
