558796563208732712,65,than why would it try to launch on something you never had? weird
558796803617718272,63,so you have had one connected at one time! thats what im asking

558797612145180677,35,first option is going to be display
558797685688238080,42,does it show more then one or just default
558799026124750868,252,well i would say_ the next time you connect the second monitor _ update drivers for monitor and then make sure you have the default one as your primary #1 monitor_ than disconnect it. updating drivers for that monitor should fix your proformance issue.
558799995017494528,159,<@!409751224187879434>  restart after you have monitor installed or after you unplugged monitor? have you tried to look for updated driver while it not in use?
558831769554518018,158,`execute at @a run setblock ~ ~-1 ~ <name of block>_` then run that in a command_block on always active and repeating or datapack using the tick function file
