558818712719982602,74,I mean_ I think livers regenerate_ don't they? You could sell half of it ðŸ¤”
558818852415209482,13,what language
558818991527690240,34,Is it your first program language?
558819654366265360,347,In human readability_ it is at follows: NLwhile Condition is true{do: action} | If condition is true before the line starts_ the loop will start_ if condition is false it will just skip the loop. After 'do:action' is executed_ the program will check again if 'Condition is true'_ and if so_ do:action will be executed again until Condition is false
558819879529086978,25,That's all there is to it
558820003923886102,67,If you aren't specific about what you don't get_ helping is useless
558820468937719808,205,x= 10NLwhile x<20{x = x+1} | Here_ x= 10_ and while it is lesser than 20_ 1 unity will be added until it is 20_ when it hits 20_ it is no longer '<20'_ so the program will go to the next line after the loop
558820554870882354,47,before the loop_ x = 10_ after the loop_ x = 20
558820845472972811,84,It just repeats X under condition Y_ until X changes something to out of condition Y
558821003837308940,44,The hardest part is the beginning either way
558821233110679573,163,Later_ you will just go 'google -> typeerrornÂº4220 package unloaded into matrix -> stackexchange' until you notice that there was a bracket or a semi colon missing
558821745709154305,22,C ++ 1 means C = C + 1
558821786020741121,53,It increases the value of the variable by that amount
558821838835286017,66,I am not into C but I think it works with other math operators too
558821926689046558,9,** and //
558822026400497699,2,No

558828767641075712,3,Yes
558828787777798165,31,Round to the nearest 2 decimals
558829036558876682,159,Though in Python it doesn't work like in scientific measuments_ it always rounds down and not up by standard unless you flicker with it. But that's just trivia

558835211396186131,28,The multiplication is wrong?
558835254119366686,34,Or are the numbers not showing up?
558836772293836820,21,That's the while loop

558837673620406283,19,What's the problem?
558837696186023967,22,16 inches are 40.64 cm
558837712363323392,17,1 inch is 2.54 cm
558837730717728769,24,Is formatting the issue?
558837778473811968,2,Oh
558837962603757568,4,Well
558838025266921499,44,First_ that while loop of yours is worthless
558838103117266959,65,It is just increasing the min value until it approaches max value
558838121127477275,31,It is not registering the steps
558838182599327755,27,can you create a list in C?
558838259426263041,100,<@210142955908890635> Can you stop being a retard while people are doing something that needs focus?
558838790161039368,137,It is printing inch as 1 first because in the beginning you stated SmallestInch = 0;NL            LargestInch = 0;NL            Inches = 1;
558839392408698882,103,printf("\nInches are %10.2lf\n Centimeters are %10.2lf"_ Inches_ Centimeters); is making the Inches = 1
558839688425766912,52,"Inches" doesn't change its value thorought the code
558839757086523416,49,It stays as 1_ so it prints "Inches are     1.00"
558840012872089610,29,That's why I suggest an Array
558840081578721281,18,a list of elements
558840568306991114,30,It doesn't print the max value
558840710992756746,47,add a "print max value" after while loop maybe?
558840884930805770,36,max value being LargestInch_ that is
558841158663536660,56,Is C even worth learning? <:damndude:272210113534623744>
558841347705143296,30,Isn't C++ a better experiment?
558841364398342150,11,investment*
558841782553804820,4,Yeah
558841873251303445,59,It helps when you don't know where the error is coming from
558842234989183022,83,Because it must start as the smallest inch_ and then walk up to LargestInch 6 by 6.
558842250927538177,5,^^yes
