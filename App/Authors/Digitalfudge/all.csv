560636965612027915,MINECRAFT,support,21,Thanks for the reply!
560637361604526081,MINECRAFT,support,130,I don't lose any progress. It just freezes for up to 10 seconds completely randomly. It almost feels as if the game is turn based.
560637991027081239,MINECRAFT,support,54,I play on all of the above. It freezes no matter what.
560638077178216448,MINECRAFT,support,33,This happens to my friend as well
560638281864445962,MINECRAFT,support,22,I have a physical copy
560638328332877855,MINECRAFT,support,44,I guess I could reinstall all of the updates
560640297768583168,MINECRAFT,multiplayer,92,<@322231571786629120> I would like an invite but I can't play until tomorrow or the weekends
560642840548343920,MINECRAFT,support,26,Reinstalling didn't fix it
560642943401328670,MINECRAFT,support,40,Tried playing and its really frustrating
560643023998943232,MINECRAFT,support,26,Wish it'd stop freezing up
