561011971642884096,Official Fortnite,creative-discussion,299,a friend and i are trying to make a map and we can't seem to figure out how the spawn pads work_ like you have the separate ones for spawning in the island and then separate ones that you spawn on for starting the game_ we've seen other map creators do that but can't seem to figure it out ourselves
