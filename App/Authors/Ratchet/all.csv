558455058761515018,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,40,played a bit more Warframe than I'd like
558455085504528395,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,45,my plans to finish Railgun tonight are ruined
558471165379608582,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,19,pants are overrated

558471480908840983,/r/Anime Discord!,games,38,I wish that theme was available to buy
558471500215091215,/r/Anime Discord!,games,3,god
558474420339867648,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,3,lol
558474433077968897,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,13,but seriously
558474440040513536,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,4,stop
558764642680438795,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,60,I don't know if this is the right spot for PC technical help
558764724284817408,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,34,if it isn't I'll move it elsewhere
558764782878982154,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,78,long story short about a week and a half ago I got a "memory management" error
558764839946682375,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,51,spent about 2 hours trying to do all kinds of tests
558764855134257162,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,24,trying to find something
558764899241558056,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,72,and I found corrupted files that my PC managed to fix by itself I guess.
558764949598371851,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,94,I don't remember the exact things I used but I can dig it out and find it if anyone is curious
558765242184892435,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,307,I assumed this fixed the problem. The computer worked normally for about 4 days and that day I decided to shut the computer off and take it downstairs for cleaning because I figured it was due for a cleaning. Long story short as the computer was shutting down (literally mid shutdown) I got the error again.
558765290893082645,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,81,After I got it I went through all the same tests I did earlier and found nothing.
558765382861848576,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,67,went to the event viewer and found a critical 41 kernal power error
558765557147762698,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,195,it's been about a week since this happened but I've been afraid to do anything on this PC out of fear that it'll happen again. I've tried to replicate things somewhat but it hasn't happened next.
558765711326052352,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,133,the only intensive thing I was doing during that entire week was emulating a SNES game. CPU/GPU temps were normal things seemed fine.
558765738370924584,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,47,I'm just unsure if it was an insolated incident
558765759988236310,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,38,or if my power supply is going to shit
558766442212884500,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,6,gotcha
558766479449915412,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,72,so the memory management error is what I should really be worrying about
558766516687077393,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,45,error 41 likely happened as a result of that?
558766784342261790,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,6,gotcha
558766872451874826,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,94,well I did most of the ram related testing that I can do via windows 10 so I assumed it's fine
558766989435469844,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,101,did windows memory diagnostic_ and there's another one I did via command prompt in administrator mode
558767328460800010,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,7,gotcha.
558767376502620160,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,80,I'll definitely do that if it happens again_ though it hasn't happened in a week
558767429367365632,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,51,unsure if that means I'm in the clear or not though
558767500486246421,/r/Anime Discord!,tech,103,I've just been really paranoid to do any gaming on this_ out of fear that it would fry the power supply

558838111614795807,/r/Anime Discord!,games,14,finished SMRPG
558838131185418242,/r/Anime Discord!,games,21,that was pretty great
559034321428676619,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,43,there are 3 other people who have done jack
559034399518228498,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,34,I'm going to do their shit tonight
559034407705640964,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,7,I can't
559034431344476160,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,45,I want to fuck them over and not do any of it
559034461761568768,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,50,but I'm not going to let my grade suffer with them
559034512592470016,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,25,it's a group presentation
559034548009304066,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,55,so if they don't do jack it should do when they present
559034870848815124,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,77,my group member was laughing about how these guys are technically HS students
559034890000269316,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,34,and they're complaining about this
559034948867325952,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,29,it's just fucking infuriating
