558474420339867648,casual,3,lol
558474433077968897,casual,13,but seriously
558474440040513536,casual,4,stop
558764642680438795,tech,60,I don't know if this is the right spot for PC technical help
558764724284817408,tech,34,if it isn't I'll move it elsewhere
558764782878982154,tech,78,long story short about a week and a half ago I got a "memory management" error
558764839946682375,tech,51,spent about 2 hours trying to do all kinds of tests
558764855134257162,tech,24,trying to find something
558764899241558056,tech,72,and I found corrupted files that my PC managed to fix by itself I guess.
558764949598371851,tech,94,I don't remember the exact things I used but I can dig it out and find it if anyone is curious
558765242184892435,tech,307,I assumed this fixed the problem. The computer worked normally for about 4 days and that day I decided to shut the computer off and take it downstairs for cleaning because I figured it was due for a cleaning. Long story short as the computer was shutting down (literally mid shutdown) I got the error again.
558765290893082645,tech,81,After I got it I went through all the same tests I did earlier and found nothing.
558765382861848576,tech,67,went to the event viewer and found a critical 41 kernal power error
558765557147762698,tech,195,it's been about a week since this happened but I've been afraid to do anything on this PC out of fear that it'll happen again. I've tried to replicate things somewhat but it hasn't happened next.
558765711326052352,tech,133,the only intensive thing I was doing during that entire week was emulating a SNES game. CPU/GPU temps were normal things seemed fine.
558765738370924584,tech,47,I'm just unsure if it was an insolated incident
558765759988236310,tech,38,or if my power supply is going to shit
558766442212884500,tech,6,gotcha
558766479449915412,tech,72,so the memory management error is what I should really be worrying about
558766516687077393,tech,45,error 41 likely happened as a result of that?
558766784342261790,tech,6,gotcha
558766872451874826,tech,94,well I did most of the ram related testing that I can do via windows 10 so I assumed it's fine
558766989435469844,tech,101,did windows memory diagnostic_ and there's another one I did via command prompt in administrator mode
558767328460800010,tech,7,gotcha.
558767376502620160,tech,80,I'll definitely do that if it happens again_ though it hasn't happened in a week
558767429367365632,tech,51,unsure if that means I'm in the clear or not though
558767500486246421,tech,103,I've just been really paranoid to do any gaming on this_ out of fear that it would fry the power supply

559034321428676619,casual,43,there are 3 other people who have done jack
559034399518228498,casual,34,I'm going to do their shit tonight
559034407705640964,casual,7,I can't
559034431344476160,casual,45,I want to fuck them over and not do any of it
559034461761568768,casual,50,but I'm not going to let my grade suffer with them
559034512592470016,casual,25,it's a group presentation
559034548009304066,casual,55,so if they don't do jack it should do when they present
559034870848815124,casual,77,my group member was laughing about how these guys are technically HS students
559034890000269316,casual,34,and they're complaining about this
559034948867325952,casual,29,it's just fucking infuriating
