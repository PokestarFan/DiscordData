559049367890165770,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,77,People legit watch it raw without subs and enjoy it not understanding a word?
559049373707665429,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,3,wut
559049532860661762,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,41,I'd assume a lot of the people here don't
559049903658237955,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,52,I've read the novels and still wouldn't watch it raw
559050324409581599,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,136,Should still be against the rules to come in here and talk about the episode because it's aired somewhere else in the world without subs
559050394525892618,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,67,Pretty sure the channel is for the subbed episodes as they come out
559050919610810380,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,135,I don't care if people watch the raw. It's just a channel for people to discuss the episode once the subbed episodes release on Crunchy
