558777768377057280,47,Sometimes I just feel invisible to other people
558778478539964426,218,Because there's always people who want to talk with my friends and I know it's because I isolate myself from tgebrest of my class but now that I'm making an effort to socialise more I notice when people don't notice me
558784844726009876,138,Yeah but it kinda hurts when you try to talk more with people and all the time you spent almost purposefully isolating yourself comes back
558784982605234176,70,<@276011064930336769> what I said isn't in regards to your message yet
558785895105560596,468,<@276011064930336769> Thank you for reminding myself that people like my friends or family care because I know it it's just that I forget sometimes. Also next year since I'll start University so I'll have to try harder to make friends or else I'll isolate myself again and don't even have friends to go back to. Also exploring one's interests is something I've never done so I might join club on things that interests me because I can always make friends out of school
558786326280011776,212,And the problem I have with my current friends is that sometimes I don't even feel close to them because we like different things but I still have my older brother to keep me company and push me to try new things
558786969337856050,78,Yeah D&D always seemed so cool to me but my friends aren't all that interested
558787150821326887,95,I've thought about joining online groups to play tabletop RPGs but never got around to doing it
558787702934339584,45,I'm in Paris so I'm sure there's a group near
558788100294180876,156,Also I've just remembered that my father is friends with people who work at a tabletop games company so I'm sure there's event where they'd played RPG games
558788499671744527,31,Thanks for your help_ goodnight
