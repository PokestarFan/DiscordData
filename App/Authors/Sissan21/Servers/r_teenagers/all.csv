558777768377057280,serious-personal-2,47,Sometimes I just feel invisible to other people
558778478539964426,serious-personal-2,218,Because there's always people who want to talk with my friends and I know it's because I isolate myself from tgebrest of my class but now that I'm making an effort to socialise more I notice when people don't notice me

558780038791692328,general,5,Daddy
558780101056135178,general,5,Yes !
558780752896983051,general,184,Actually I love my real dad because he's always trying to get the best for his children so I don't need another father_ if anyone wants to get adopted by vSpeckk they can take my place
558780926398693406,general,32,Sorry I can find you another one
558781099438768139,general,42,Shit being vSpeckk's son sounds cool again

558781216132956170,general,14,Double p juice
558781387088592906,general,68,<@463877297238310938> oof for the hours but good on you for doing it
558783733403222017,self,58,I saw you talking about your new haircut but not the photo
558784472888246304,self,162,<@535504211673088001> I think it looks cool but the last time I got a new haircut it took me a few days to accustom myself with it and to know how to comb my hair
558784844726009876,serious-personal-2,138,Yeah but it kinda hurts when you try to talk more with people and all the time you spent almost purposefully isolating yourself comes back
558784982605234176,serious-personal-2,70,<@276011064930336769> what I said isn't in regards to your message yet
558785895105560596,serious-personal-2,468,<@276011064930336769> Thank you for reminding myself that people like my friends or family care because I know it it's just that I forget sometimes. Also next year since I'll start University so I'll have to try harder to make friends or else I'll isolate myself again and don't even have friends to go back to. Also exploring one's interests is something I've never done so I might join club on things that interests me because I can always make friends out of school
558786326280011776,serious-personal-2,212,And the problem I have with my current friends is that sometimes I don't even feel close to them because we like different things but I still have my older brother to keep me company and push me to try new things

558786969337856050,serious-personal-2,78,Yeah D&D always seemed so cool to me but my friends aren't all that interested
558787150821326887,serious-personal-2,95,I've thought about joining online groups to play tabletop RPGs but never got around to doing it

558787702934339584,serious-personal-2,45,I'm in Paris so I'm sure there's a group near
558788100294180876,serious-personal-2,156,Also I've just remembered that my father is friends with people who work at a tabletop games company so I'm sure there's event where they'd played RPG games
