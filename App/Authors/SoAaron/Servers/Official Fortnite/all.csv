558831344109748244,battle-royale,45,Just create an account? <@430536606353588224>
558834053550178316,battle-royale,28,Why do skins matter so much?
558842749772759049,battle-royale,17,5 20 damage shots
558843047014694922,battle-royale,127,Tac is the only gun I can think of that is completely original to Fortnite. All others are based on real weapons. Well majority
558843140711120896,battle-royale,28,The only gun worth mentionin
558843232482623529,battle-royale,64,If I was to get good_ I'd just use a pump <@!274708654140162061>
558843307510464513,battle-royale,43,Cause with good aim_ pump is clearly better
558843469209141249,battle-royale,57,If you hit your shots accurately for both_ pump is better
558843686893518859,battle-royale,64,And what if my 1 shot was your head for 200 damage_ oh your dead
558844129539522560,battle-royale,139,Yeah but if you're good_ you shouldn't be missing. I get what you mean but that doesn't mean its better_ its just  better for worse players
558844374729883658,battle-royale,104,Tac is good until you get 1 shot by a pump with 200 HP then realise the pump is clearing better with aim
558844457273786378,battle-royale,24,Okay have fun with a tac
558844552417378324,battle-royale,19,How'd they mess up?
558844621032128553,battle-royale,9,Well yeah
558844923743436816,battle-royale,113,Personally I think tac is for players with worse aim who needs more faster shots with less damage so its balanced
558845064613462027,battle-royale,99,Its not even possible to get 6 damage. Well if you use it close range like a shotgun should be used
558845277583179798,battle-royale,46,Yeah but 1 shot to head with pump_ you're dead
558845380586897409,battle-royale,13,No. Blue pump
558845476607229988,battle-royale,11,yeah I know
558845733277532161,battle-royale,20,You need 5 shots lol
558845994662494208,battle-royale,46,Yeah_ with building_ pump is better_ very true
558846096911368203,battle-royale,70,Hit 1 pump_ build so you can't hit those 5 shots then hit the 2nd shot
558846345977397248,battle-royale,17,What's your epic?
558846786899410945,battle-royale,8,have fun

558994319936061460,battle-royale,30,If life is life_ what is life?
558994518205005824,battle-royale,16,Life is somethin
558994761315385345,battle-royale,12,Probably not
558994855582236702,battle-royale,47,That would screw over people who earnt level 80
558994941334781952,battle-royale,28,So then why do u deserve it?
558995073736638464,battle-royale,36,Now everyone should have max carbide
558995166854250496,battle-royale,55,Level 65 really isn't a high level if you like the game
558995454541430785,battle-royale,103,I don't think they'll let people earn omega lights. I did get level 80 in season 4 but I never use Omea
558995539698384898,battle-royale,8,omegalul
558995840342163489,battle-royale,79,My 3 most used skins at the moment are scarlet defender_ laguna and elite agent
558996123302232065,battle-royale,49,Funny cause I didn't mean to get scarlet defender
558996419944382475,battle-royale,76,Whats the problem with Xbox and PS4 in the same lobby? <@437799460353998851>
558996821423161344,battle-royale,27,But what is the difference?
558997089430798337,battle-royale,4,True
558997202228346895,battle-royale,67,It should say beside their name whether they're Xbox or Playstation
559002535671627779,battle-royale,8,Good job

559007914468048917,battle-royale,33,Probably yeah if you get reported
559007991194451993,battle-royale,36,It called teaming and yeah_ cheating
559009498602405892,battle-royale,113,You can probably get it. I didn't check my email for it. I just saw some video and it linked how to get the recap
