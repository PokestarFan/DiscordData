559076932365582346,Egg_ Inc,general,140,there isn't one based on a percentage or a number. the percentage will keep getting smaller_ the number bigger_ the more often you prestige.
559078086067355678,Egg_ Inc,general,167,some people like to prestige at a lower population_ once the SE gains start to slow (somewhere between 800m and 1.2b seem to be most common_ though I have seen lower).
559078317995851778,Egg_ Inc,general,194,I have tried that (and many_ many other tests) several times. I absolutely get more SE quicker by filling the habs. But everyones device/play style combination creates different results_ so ymmv
