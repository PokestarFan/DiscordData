559004689060986901,80,Charles berg there is a chart of recommended EBs pinned in <#455385659079917569>
559076932365582346,140,there isn't one based on a percentage or a number. the percentage will keep getting smaller_ the number bigger_ the more often you prestige.
559078086067355678,167,some people like to prestige at a lower population_ once the SE gains start to slow (somewhere between 800m and 1.2b seem to be most common_ though I have seen lower).
559078317995851778,194,I have tried that (and many_ many other tests) several times. I absolutely get more SE quicker by filling the habs. But everyones device/play style combination creates different results_ so ymmv
559089481802711041,128,swiping for the drones gives a bunch of intersection points possible for the drone_ plus swiping won't open any of the buildings
559089630033608709,72,that plus Farm to Table was my salvation until i "gotgud" at drone hunts
559090411545690124,164,completely agree_ Quail_ though i think i personally get more frustrated at tapping an elite and opening the silos instead than i get satisfaction from hitting hit.
559097088131072011,26,lots and lots of prestiges
559098929443242007,158,i have considered doing that. but i am closing in on 1400 anyway_ and i think that only matters if there happens to be some new way of getting way too many pe
559099688884895744,123,this is the first incremental game i played. i had no idea what this was until i played it for a while. (i came for the AR)
559099904698613772,119,^ that (called Farm to Table in this game_ and I believe its only ios still_ despite what it says in android app store)
560286966805954581,39,prolly_ but i am not testing that one ðŸ˜ƒ
560625086487330816,64,jump to the most recent pin_ the story happened right before it.
560625232348577802,141,tl:dr person glitched a re-contract so quickly they didn't lose the PE until after they finished_ so the appear to have permanently lost a pe
560625712453779457,57,(entirely possible the details were_ uh_ wrong_ lets say)
560629206619521024,141,it is entirely possible dude was frustrated and not entirely truthful/knowledgeable about what happened. that was the impression i got anyway
