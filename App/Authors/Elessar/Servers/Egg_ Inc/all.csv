558434203705016322,contract-talk,142,you should be able to re-install the game to get the question again. just make sure you have an up to date cloud back up before you delete it.
558435591260471297,contract-talk,114,check in the apps settings.  hit more where it says privacy and data. It will tell you when your last back up was.
558435661875773461,contract-talk,51,Neko - Switching eggs or farms will force an update
558435824719626241,contract-talk,149,forcing a download I have only been able to do by reinstalling the game (one direction works fine_ going back the other way takes a reinstall for me)
558443312999301121,contract-talk,149,It backs up periodically on its own_ but switching eggs or farms (only if you have a contract) is the only thing Iâ€™ve seen that forces it right then.

558854307043344424,offtopic,61,no. never. no fantasy worlds_ no epic adventures. not for me.
558855066493255691,offtopic,145,very much is. my online name for the last 35 years has been one version of one of the most epic fantasy heroes in all literature (and movies now)
558855232944078868,offtopic,45,i am often reading or watching fantasy worlds
558858146047590402,offtopic,88,Estel_ Thorongil_ Strider_ Dunadan_ Aragorn_ King Elessar Telcontar. a man of many names
558859479811358729,offtopic,89,Dunedain are the rangers of the north. Dunadan is Man of the North and the Dunadan is him
558859571410632704,offtopic,73,tolkien was way too verbose_ though i love his world the detail is insane
558862903579639818,offtopic,195,never made it through. tried three different times. i LOVE the Lord of the Rings. the rest of Tolkien isn't great. The Hobbit is one of the best children's books ever_ but it is a children's book
559004689060986901,general,80,Charles berg there is a chart of recommended EBs pinned in <#455385659079917569>

559052324136419328,offtopic,76,car picked up. 930 am and nothing left to do. <https://youtu.be/h4UqMyldS7Q>
559076932365582346,general,140,there isn't one based on a percentage or a number. the percentage will keep getting smaller_ the number bigger_ the more often you prestige.
559078086067355678,general,167,some people like to prestige at a lower population_ once the SE gains start to slow (somewhere between 800m and 1.2b seem to be most common_ though I have seen lower).
559078317995851778,general,194,I have tried that (and many_ many other tests) several times. I absolutely get more SE quicker by filling the habs. But everyones device/play style combination creates different results_ so ymmv
559078645243707426,offtopic,49,also Hurley as Jack is both fitting and hilarious
559089481802711041,general,128,swiping for the drones gives a bunch of intersection points possible for the drone_ plus swiping won't open any of the buildings
559089630033608709,general,72,that plus Farm to Table was my salvation until i "gotgud" at drone hunts
559090411545690124,general,164,completely agree_ Quail_ though i think i personally get more frustrated at tapping an elite and opening the silos instead than i get satisfaction from hitting hit.
559097088131072011,general,26,lots and lots of prestiges

559098929443242007,general,158,i have considered doing that. but i am closing in on 1400 anyway_ and i think that only matters if there happens to be some new way of getting way too many pe
559099688884895744,general,123,this is the first incremental game i played. i had no idea what this was until i played it for a while. (i came for the AR)
559099904698613772,general,119,^ that (called Farm to Table in this game_ and I believe its only ios still_ despite what it says in android app store)
