559012766716002314,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,26,Consider reading the rules

560627616168804383,/r/SwordArtOnline,images,40,From the sound of it_ HF3 should be okay
560627652264853524,/r/SwordArtOnline,images,71,Seems the investigation and everything is going to take quite some time
560628642321793024,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,43,Kirito has friends with vaginas_ how horrid
560628876146114562,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,72,Didn't realize friend groups required equal numbers of males and females
560629476376182786,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,56,<@411367718046924814> Accel World spoilers don't go here
560630444589056014,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,5,False
560630515078529027,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,82,Eugeo would get sidelined just like every single other deuteragonist in the series
560630611811893248,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,21,On the grounds of...?
560630852627857410,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,80,I'm not sure what series you're reading_ but Asuna got sidelined pretty hard too
560631044047634442,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,26,Only took three story arcs
560631218140479518,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,98,Literally every other character gets shelved_ assuming Eugeo would be any different is nonsensical
560631327926517800,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,82,Also_ to backtrack a bit_ I was not "twisting your words into straw man arguments"
560631407958032384,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,3,Yes
560631521841643530,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,139,```i am so sick of the "another female joins Kirito's troupe" thing that prevails through the seriesNLEugeo would've been a good balancer```
560631665702207508,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,126,How is the logical conclusion there anything but assuming that "balancer" refers to balancing the number of males and females?
560631886603485185,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,34,And you have *now* made that clear
560631967528255491,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,74,But mine was the only logical conclusion based on your statements thus far
560632009983131655,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,89,>it quite frankly is true that the majority of his friendgroup has feelings toward Kirito
560632252845785100,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,22,She's also dead_ so...
560632372567998464,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,68,As for the others_ I'd have to reread that part before making claims
560632692924874762,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,9,It is not
560633097306243103,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,23,Looking at 18 right now
560633233679843341,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,92,Shino and Sugu give no inclination as to what the feelings they're going to state to him are
560633745884053504,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,26,Liz and Silica do_ however

560636063874547732,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,1,k
560636776000127021,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,37,Because that was the implication_ yes
560637202246139916,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,132,Okay first of all_ a logical interpretation based on context clues and implications is not even close to hyperbolic reinterpretation
560637322375200781,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,137,Second_ what benefit of the doubt is there when there's only one logical conclusion to draw based on said context clues and implications?
