560630852627857410,80,I'm not sure what series you're reading_ but Asuna got sidelined pretty hard too
560631044047634442,26,Only took three story arcs
560631218140479518,98,Literally every other character gets shelved_ assuming Eugeo would be any different is nonsensical

560632692924874762,9,It is not
560633097306243103,23,Looking at 18 right now
560633233679843341,92,Shino and Sugu give no inclination as to what the feelings they're going to state to him are
560633745884053504,26,Liz and Silica do_ however
