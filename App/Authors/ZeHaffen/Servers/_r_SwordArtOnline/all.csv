560627616168804383,images,40,From the sound of it_ HF3 should be okay
560627652264853524,images,71,Seems the investigation and everything is going to take quite some time

560628876146114562,untranslated-spoilers,72,Didn't realize friend groups required equal numbers of males and females

560630444589056014,untranslated-spoilers,5,False
560630515078529027,untranslated-spoilers,82,Eugeo would get sidelined just like every single other deuteragonist in the series
560630611811893248,untranslated-spoilers,21,On the grounds of...?
560630852627857410,untranslated-spoilers,80,I'm not sure what series you're reading_ but Asuna got sidelined pretty hard too
560631044047634442,untranslated-spoilers,26,Only took three story arcs
560631218140479518,untranslated-spoilers,98,Literally every other character gets shelved_ assuming Eugeo would be any different is nonsensical
560631327926517800,untranslated-spoilers,82,Also_ to backtrack a bit_ I was not "twisting your words into straw man arguments"

560632252845785100,untranslated-spoilers,22,She's also dead_ so...
560632372567998464,untranslated-spoilers,68,As for the others_ I'd have to reread that part before making claims
560632692924874762,untranslated-spoilers,9,It is not
560633097306243103,untranslated-spoilers,23,Looking at 18 right now
