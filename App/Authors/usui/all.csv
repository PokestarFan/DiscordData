558792529349443595,r/teenagers,debates,88,apparently she started dating some right wing guy and then did an ideological about-face
558792545006518293,r/teenagers,debates,22,according to this post
558792577093074969,r/teenagers,debates,31,racially insensitive =/= racist

558793361444569101,r/teenagers,debates,88,abortions a debate where there will never be compromise and it always takes like 4 hours
558793911724670988,r/teenagers,debates,217,abortions should be easily available and shouldn't be bannedNLhowever late term abortions should be bad_ and abortions should only be legal under certain circumstances; i.e rape_ incest_ if it threatens the mother/baby
558794361450528768,r/teenagers,debates,103,the morality of the debate is one that is hard to reach compromise on because its effectively two sides
558794395705671689,r/teenagers,debates,58,does birth confer life or conception/gestation confer life
558794449363402752,r/teenagers,debates,57,whichever side you choose will dictate the morality of it
558795339767873552,r/teenagers,debates,40,i think azul raises a fair point on that
558795407195504640,r/teenagers,debates,77,i do still disagree_ personally I think the potential of life makes it amoral
558795490100248576,r/teenagers,debates,50,it is overdone because it’s a very either or topic
558795648426573836,r/teenagers,debates,51,but you can educate them on proper contraception if
558795709630119941,r/teenagers,debates,49,that was the gayest way to phrase that niquel lol
558796173641515008,r/teenagers,debates,46,why do you need to say that three times niquel
558796177362124800,r/teenagers,debates,39,contraception =\= stopping from banging
558797430485942302,r/teenagers,debates,78,my mum gives me condoms if I ask which is low key fucking odd but epic style 😎
558797566616010752,r/teenagers,debates,44,we should get a more productive debate going
558797776750903316,r/teenagers,debates,56,yes_ because if you want to die you are not worth living
558797833705226242,r/teenagers,debates,7,not rly
558798180939071500,r/teenagers,debates,1,^
558798202514440192,r/teenagers,debates,87,as long as it is a genuine will to die not temporary mental instability they should die
558798537949708306,r/teenagers,debates,1,^
558798694233931786,r/teenagers,debates,39,i don’t believe in 100% bodily autonomy
558798754812264485,r/teenagers,debates,58,the same way there shouldn’t be 100% intellectual autonomy
558799174628540430,r/teenagers,debates,32,What precedent is that Cthulhuwu
558799317155184670,r/teenagers,debates,3,yes
558799325074030607,r/teenagers,debates,10,You do not
558799431567409164,r/teenagers,debates,57,No_ because their problems will likely be fixed with time
558799772761194516,r/teenagers,debates,62,That’s an extreme scenario and basically a straw man Cthulhuwu
558799942794346506,r/teenagers,debates,61,But public euthanasia isn’t entirely removing bodily autonomy
558799977057615882,r/teenagers,debates,37,Youre making it an either or scenario
558799984120561675,r/teenagers,debates,11,No it isn’t
558800008598781963,r/teenagers,debates,11,No it isn’t

558800440104321046,r/teenagers,debates,12,No it is not
558800937276145664,r/teenagers,debates,64,You are intentionally misrepresenting that information Cthulhuwu
558801027952803861,r/teenagers,debates,106,This is the table Cthulhuwu is referencing_ suicide is legal_ euthanasia/assisted suicide depends on state
558801092348215319,r/teenagers,debates,35,You did not specify that originally
558801119090835457,r/teenagers,debates,21,You just said suicide
558801133141753856,r/teenagers,debates,12,No it wasn’t
558801170940952576,r/teenagers,debates,45,Noah said it wasn’t illegal to commit suicide
558801188183605278,r/teenagers,debates,23,And you said yes it was
558801248552222732,r/teenagers,debates,67,You were responding not positing_ and thus there was no implication
558801416655994881,r/teenagers,debates,45,No it’s not whole lot around assisted suicide
558801609140994049,r/teenagers,debates,13,He blocked me
558801658402963457,r/teenagers,debates,76,He said he has an irrational hatred towards me in other chat for some reason
558801726120132619,r/teenagers,debates,27,You were not proven correct
558801762106998794,r/teenagers,debates,66,You were proven correct in a different statement to what Noah said
558801794973827082,r/teenagers,debates,55,No it isn’t on that_ it’s on the right to kill yourself
558801820328263701,r/teenagers,debates,37,There’s two parts to the conversation
558801856491421736,r/teenagers,debates,36,Leave if you do not want to be civil
558801905590206504,r/teenagers,debates,37,no soz that’s what Noah said about me
558801927882932224,r/teenagers,debates,20,Idc if he blocked me
558801987374678038,r/teenagers,debates,11,No it isn’t
558802006836248627,r/teenagers,debates,22,This is not productive
558802112289701900,r/teenagers,debates,34,public schoolers are all plebs lel
558802216396390410,r/teenagers,debates,47,as with most_ the private sector does it better
558802315306467329,r/teenagers,debates,43,yeah bht it’s consensual to pay for it zero
558802342082773004,r/teenagers,debates,42,My mum pays for mine becos she has a brain
558802373733122058,r/teenagers,debates,41,And knows that state schools are btec asf
558802512413458433,r/teenagers,debates,100,State schools are fine_ but generally private schools will offer better service in exchange for cost
558802531942400001,r/teenagers,debates,40,I don’t see why it’s an either or debate
558803031823482880,r/teenagers,debates,54,Yeah but that’s not 12 years until the world is ending
558803270328385592,r/teenagers,debates,110,The article suggests 2100 as the timeframe when there is significant population damage as a result of flooding
558803408258334731,r/teenagers,debates,55,In the end it’s mostly inferior countries being hit tbh
558803474721013780,r/teenagers,debates,56,The US would mostly survive if there was severe flooding
558803499987501087,r/teenagers,debates,37,Along with much of continental Europe
558803522150465633,r/teenagers,debates,19,And the Middle East
558803546494074891,r/teenagers,debates,9,Okay cool

558807663895511050,r/teenagers,debates,176,Yeah but Cthuluwu your article on Poland only suggests the centralization of power in the executive as a result of the undermining of judicial independence not outright fascism
