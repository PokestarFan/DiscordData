558789378663645214,debates,82,a lot of them are kidnapped as boys and fed hormones to be prostituted in the city
558789764535418890,debates,297,<@346090620881862658> one of my close mates is a thai prince or whatever whos parents are in politics he was telling me about it. i cant find anything on english language sources on my school wifi (its very censored)_ i can ask him if he can give me something tomorrow morning translated from thai
558790870183444530,debates,21,lets get a deb8 going
558791014379421696,debates,22,then leave the channel
558791385520537603,debates,2,no
558791399982628884,debates,18,no races mentioned
558791735388667919,debates,2,ok
558791753982017585,debates,42,can we get something actually going please
558792020383105044,debates,46,and all of those people are inherently racist?
558792315288944661,debates,31,wait laci green went right wing
558792324566745099,debates,19,when did this hapen
558792391470088214,debates,29,ok this is a pointless debate
558792529349443595,debates,88,apparently she started dating some right wing guy and then did an ideological about-face
558792545006518293,debates,22,according to this post
558792577093074969,debates,31,racially insensitive =/= racist
558792745792045092,debates,32,okay can we get an actual debate
558792844253462547,debates,63,<@!325983451331166208> you realize the sub you linked is satire
558792885135212544,debates,80,as in_ the posts they make are laughing at people who actually believe hat stuff
558793005381976064,debates,2,ok
558793019185299464,debates,13,change topics
558793361444569101,debates,88,abortions a debate where there will never be compromise and it always takes like 4 hours
558793911724670988,debates,217,abortions should be easily available and shouldn't be bannedNLhowever late term abortions should be bad_ and abortions should only be legal under certain circumstances; i.e rape_ incest_ if it threatens the mother/baby
558794361450528768,debates,103,the morality of the debate is one that is hard to reach compromise on because its effectively two sides
558794395705671689,debates,58,does birth confer life or conception/gestation confer life
558794449363402752,debates,57,whichever side you choose will dictate the morality of it
558795339767873552,debates,40,i think azul raises a fair point on that
558795407195504640,debates,77,i do still disagree_ personally I think the potential of life makes it amoral
558795490100248576,debates,50,it is overdone because itâ€™s a very either or topic
558795648426573836,debates,51,but you can educate them on proper contraception if
558795709630119941,debates,49,that was the gayest way to phrase that niquel lol
558796173641515008,debates,46,why do you need to say that three times niquel
558796177362124800,debates,39,contraception =\= stopping from banging
558797430485942302,debates,78,my mum gives me condoms if I ask which is low key fucking odd but epic style ðŸ˜Ž
558797566616010752,debates,44,we should get a more productive debate going
558797776750903316,debates,56,yes_ because if you want to die you are not worth living
558797833705226242,debates,7,not rly
558798180939071500,debates,1,^
558798202514440192,debates,87,as long as it is a genuine will to die not temporary mental instability they should die
558798537949708306,debates,1,^
558798694233931786,debates,39,i donâ€™t believe in 100% bodily autonomy
558798754812264485,debates,58,the same way there shouldnâ€™t be 100% intellectual autonomy
558799174628540430,debates,32,What precedent is that Cthulhuwu
558799317155184670,debates,3,yes
558799325074030607,debates,10,You do not
558799431567409164,debates,57,No_ because their problems will likely be fixed with time
558799772761194516,debates,62,Thatâ€™s an extreme scenario and basically a straw man Cthulhuwu
558799942794346506,debates,61,But public euthanasia isnâ€™t entirely removing bodily autonomy
558799977057615882,debates,37,Youre making it an either or scenario
558799984120561675,debates,11,No it isnâ€™t
558800008598781963,debates,11,No it isnâ€™t
558800137464446987,debates,58,Suicide was illegal in the 50s lmao what are u even saying
558800166207881240,debates,34,Unless ur in some shithole country
558800405887451146,debates,20,What country is that
558800440104321046,debates,12,No it is not
558800937276145664,debates,64,You are intentionally misrepresenting that information Cthulhuwu
558801027952803861,debates,106,This is the table Cthulhuwu is referencing_ suicide is legal_ euthanasia/assisted suicide depends on state
558801092348215319,debates,35,You did not specify that originally
558801119090835457,debates,21,You just said suicide
558801133141753856,debates,12,No it wasnâ€™t
558801170940952576,debates,45,Noah said it wasnâ€™t illegal to commit suicide
558801188183605278,debates,23,And you said yes it was
558801248552222732,debates,67,You were responding not positing_ and thus there was no implication
558801416655994881,debates,45,No itâ€™s not whole lot around assisted suicide
558801609140994049,debates,13,He blocked me
558801658402963457,debates,76,He said he has an irrational hatred towards me in other chat for some reason
558801726120132619,debates,27,You were not proven correct
558801762106998794,debates,66,You were proven correct in a different statement to what Noah said
558801794973827082,debates,55,No it isnâ€™t on that_ itâ€™s on the right to kill yourself
558801820328263701,debates,37,Thereâ€™s two parts to the conversation
558801856491421736,debates,36,Leave if you do not want to be civil
558801905590206504,debates,37,no soz thatâ€™s what Noah said about me
558801927882932224,debates,20,Idc if he blocked me
558801987374678038,debates,11,No it isnâ€™t
558802006836248627,debates,22,This is not productive
558802112289701900,debates,34,public schoolers are all plebs lel
558802216396390410,debates,47,as with most_ the private sector does it better
558802315306467329,debates,43,yeah bht itâ€™s consensual to pay for it zero
558802342082773004,debates,42,My mum pays for mine becos she has a brain
558802373733122058,debates,41,And knows that state schools are btec asf
558802512413458433,debates,100,State schools are fine_ but generally private schools will offer better service in exchange for cost
558802531942400001,debates,40,I donâ€™t see why itâ€™s an either or debate
558803031823482880,debates,54,Yeah but thatâ€™s not 12 years until the world is ending
558803270328385592,debates,110,The article suggests 2100 as the timeframe when there is significant population damage as a result of flooding
558803408258334731,debates,55,In the end itâ€™s mostly inferior countries being hit tbh
558803474721013780,debates,56,The US would mostly survive if there was severe flooding
558803499987501087,debates,37,Along with much of continental Europe
558803522150465633,debates,19,And the Middle East
558803546494074891,debates,9,Okay cool
558803613045227520,debates,47,The Mississippi River area isnâ€™t most of the US
558803636449443860,debates,26,Florida would be destroyed
558803784868823067,debates,143,<@186569274628767745> yes im saying that a island countries in the pacific or Southeast Asia are less important globally than western countries
558803865928204341,debates,112,<@325739257622691841> you only have me blocked because you disagree with me lol? Not very productive to anything
558803989882470416,debates,47,Yeah I donâ€™t sit in <#278625925170462720> daily
558804060954689540,debates,17,I agree Cthulhuwu
558804222225809410,debates,120,Ethnostates will always have eventual instability unless thereâ€™s actual genocide against all minorities within a country
558804675374350336,debates,1,^
558804817515118612,debates,29,That doesnâ€™t mean neo-fascist
558804845046530073,debates,19,Absolutely not woke
558805015959961621,debates,71,Imagine blocking people in debates literally this is aids being blocked

558805795559440408,debates,53,Can someone tell Cthulhuwu to check my messages there
558805936236396544,debates,4,Bruh
558805991643152416,debates,58,Imagine blocking and flaming people that disagree with you
558806070081093642,debates,47,Thatâ€™s the only reason May is still in office N
558806099000557597,debates,51,Is because no one wants to captain her sinking ship
558806409911992341,debates,82,Noah y do you even have me blocked aside from the irrational dislike u have for me
558806450584158219,debates,1,ðŸ‘º
558806816977453057,debates,70,I mean Noah weâ€™ve had productive debates before idk why you blocked me
558807663895511050,debates,176,Yeah but Cthuluwu your article on Poland only suggests the centralization of power in the executive as a result of the undermining of judicial independence not outright fascism
558808027000733716,debates,82,That feeling when u read his articles but he has u blocked and wonâ€™t respond #epic
