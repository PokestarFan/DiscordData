559052843970068493,95,Well the trick is to use some of their techniques and philosophies on your own original builds.
559053040305307681,113,Like this is an interesting roof idea_ you can use it on anything that's supposed to be remotely like that style.
559053555370164257,111,Or here's another style of buildings I haven't seen a bunch of people do. I don't even know what you'd call it.
