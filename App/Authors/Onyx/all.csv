559052228044914709,MINECRAFT,fbc,60,Yep definitely not gonna be done. Stupid tooth infection. :/
559052369674108944,MINECRAFT,builds,19,Hermitcraft videos.
559052517913133076,MINECRAFT,builds,50,They build lots of weird and awesome things there.
559052843970068493,MINECRAFT,builds,95,Well the trick is to use some of their techniques and philosophies on your own original builds.
559053040305307681,MINECRAFT,builds,113,Like this is an interesting roof idea_ you can use it on anything that's supposed to be remotely like that style.
559053555370164257,MINECRAFT,builds,111,Or here's another style of buildings I haven't seen a bunch of people do. I don't even know what you'd call it.
559053805962919952,MINECRAFT,builds,61,My friend said it looked vaguely French but I don't know lol.
559054196880703488,MINECRAFT,builds,98,But yeah basically just figure out a style for each build so it doesn't look like random junk lol.
559055068473851944,MINECRAFT,builds,84,And for terraforming_ I really like GoodTimesWithScar. He does awesome insane stuff.
559077877983871006,MINECRAFT,builds,98,I mean_ if we had wall versions of almost every block_ those would basically be vertical slabs. ;)
559078140803285012,MINECRAFT,builds,125,The only kind of wood I don't really like is acacia. Too orange. But yet I love acacia trees because they're shaped weird. :P
559078417161650177,MINECRAFT,builds,83,I don't even know what the new textures look like because I use a texture pack lol.
559078548493697037,MINECRAFT,builds,64,I love lanterns though. They look awesome hanging off of things.
559078665800122368,MINECRAFT,builds,34,What does glowstone look like now?
560949409374928906,MINECRAFT,builds,47,Make your base a giant pencil for no reason. :P
560949839945400360,MINECRAFT,builds,139,If I tried to build in survival I'd just lose patience. I need too many blocks and too many rare types and that'd just limit my creativity.
560949922418130945,MINECRAFT,builds,61,I mean_ it takes me months to build some things as it is lol.
560950065083187200,MINECRAFT,builds,73,Survival seems really fun but I prefer watching other people play it lol.
560950386437914645,MINECRAFT,builds,98,Imagine the pain of building this in survival. I'd have died so many times from falling damage. :P
560950662259539979,MINECRAFT,builds,117,But then I watch hermitcraft and they build insane stuff IN SURVIVAL and I don't know how they have the patience lol.
560954866848104449,MINECRAFT,builds,88,I just never place more than 5 of the same block together lol. I pretend it's Tetris. :P
