559052517913133076,MINECRAFT,builds,50,They build lots of weird and awesome things there.
559052843970068493,MINECRAFT,builds,95,Well the trick is to use some of their techniques and philosophies on your own original builds.
559053040305307681,MINECRAFT,builds,113,Like this is an interesting roof idea_ you can use it on anything that's supposed to be remotely like that style.
559053555370164257,MINECRAFT,builds,111,Or here's another style of buildings I haven't seen a bunch of people do. I don't even know what you'd call it.
559053805962919952,MINECRAFT,builds,61,My friend said it looked vaguely French but I don't know lol.
559054196880703488,MINECRAFT,builds,98,But yeah basically just figure out a style for each build so it doesn't look like random junk lol.
559055068473851944,MINECRAFT,builds,84,And for terraforming_ I really like GoodTimesWithScar. He does awesome insane stuff.

559078140803285012,MINECRAFT,builds,125,The only kind of wood I don't really like is acacia. Too orange. But yet I love acacia trees because they're shaped weird. :P
559078417161650177,MINECRAFT,builds,83,I don't even know what the new textures look like because I use a texture pack lol.
559078548493697037,MINECRAFT,builds,64,I love lanterns though. They look awesome hanging off of things.
559078665800122368,MINECRAFT,builds,34,What does glowstone look like now?
