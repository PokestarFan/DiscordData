559001760060932106,48,although_ representative democracy is pretty bad
559002032162209802,177,because instead of making people think about politics_ it encourages for people to vote based on a few issuesNLwhich leads to people expecting politicians to do thinking for them
559002060482412564,33,so you get a population of people
559002078173986817,28,who dont understand politics
559002225897373727,80,wait what point are you arguing_ the mentally challenged one or the rep dem bad?

559021359242543109,10,Massivelyy
559021512418656271,18,Not the point here
559021553279434753,29,I'm just debunking his points
559022005559754752,92,Also_ our work hours have gone down because we've exported most factory labour to sweatshops
559022045489397761,33,Where hours are ridiculously high
559022127450161172,49,<@325983451331166208> then people lose their jobs
559022309596201014,13,not this time
559022364369747980,58,the number of jobs lost would be larger than the jobs made
559022376843739175,9,And again
559022419600474122,32,I'm just debunking jellos points
559022495919767563,55,<@553706362438287361> because ai will take lots of jobs
559022534864142377,39,Way more than the industrial revolution
559022641747329024,50,also jelle_ lpf is more accurate than unemployment
559022828079546370,39,you should read the article I lined you
559022839324344321,3,and
559022875957395462,19,if we automate jobs
559022917111906325,50,Then the tools of automation should not be private
559022934677782558,21,Because at that point
559023092362641441,51,with very little labour needed to produce something
559034519940890655,40,it depends on what you mean by integrate
559034553843580960,14,culturally? no
559034830281637902,52,learning the language is nesseccary most of the time
559034858899374090,28,It's hard to live without it
559035004592717825,76,<@379292701197336586> how do you live a full life in the us without English?
559035086301822976,47,but they shouldn't be forced to embrace culture
559035282813354011,42,embracing american culture isn't nessecary
559035327117787136,41,plenty of born Americans don't embrace it
559035364094771201,30,<@550993202291802114> strawman
559035375545221140,16,Nobody does that
559035550414274573,96,<@550993202291802114> my point was that its hard to move countries without learning the panguage
559035620266082325,31,<@550993202291802114> well yeah
559035967147606036,29,<@378627967435145219> they do
559038375923810333,70,Also_ the government had been cutting funding for free English lessons
559038413593116683,27,so its been harder to learn
