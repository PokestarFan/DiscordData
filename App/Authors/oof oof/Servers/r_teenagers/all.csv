559002032162209802,debates,177,because instead of making people think about politics_ it encourages for people to vote based on a few issuesNLwhich leads to people expecting politicians to do thinking for them
559002060482412564,debates,33,so you get a population of people
559002078173986817,debates,28,who dont understand politics
559002225897373727,debates,80,wait what point are you arguing_ the mentally challenged one or the rep dem bad?

559021359242543109,debates,10,Massivelyy
559021512418656271,debates,18,Not the point here
559021553279434753,debates,29,I'm just debunking his points
559022005559754752,debates,92,Also_ our work hours have gone down because we've exported most factory labour to sweatshops
559022045489397761,debates,33,Where hours are ridiculously high
559022127450161172,debates,49,<@325983451331166208> then people lose their jobs
559022309596201014,debates,13,not this time
559022364369747980,debates,58,the number of jobs lost would be larger than the jobs made
559022376843739175,debates,9,And again
559022419600474122,debates,32,I'm just debunking jellos points
559022495919767563,debates,55,<@553706362438287361> because ai will take lots of jobs
559022534864142377,debates,39,Way more than the industrial revolution
559022641747329024,debates,50,also jelle_ lpf is more accurate than unemployment
559022828079546370,debates,39,you should read the article I lined you
559022839324344321,debates,3,and
559022875957395462,debates,19,if we automate jobs
559022917111906325,debates,50,Then the tools of automation should not be private
559022934677782558,debates,21,Because at that point
559023092362641441,debates,51,with very little labour needed to produce something
