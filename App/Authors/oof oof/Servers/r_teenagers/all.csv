559002060482412564,debates,33,so you get a population of people
559002078173986817,debates,28,who dont understand politics

559021512418656271,debates,18,Not the point here
559021553279434753,debates,29,I'm just debunking his points
559022005559754752,debates,92,Also_ our work hours have gone down because we've exported most factory labour to sweatshops
559022045489397761,debates,33,Where hours are ridiculously high
559022127450161172,debates,49,<@325983451331166208> then people lose their jobs
559022309596201014,debates,13,not this time
559022364369747980,debates,58,the number of jobs lost would be larger than the jobs made

559022641747329024,debates,50,also jelle_ lpf is more accurate than unemployment
559022828079546370,debates,39,you should read the article I lined you
559022839324344321,debates,3,and
559022875957395462,debates,19,if we automate jobs
559022917111906325,debates,50,Then the tools of automation should not be private
559022934677782558,debates,21,Because at that point
559023092362641441,debates,51,with very little labour needed to produce something
559034519940890655,debates,40,it depends on what you mean by integrate
559034553843580960,debates,14,culturally? no
