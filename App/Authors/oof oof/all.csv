559021553279434753,r/teenagers,debates,29,I'm just debunking his points
559022005559754752,r/teenagers,debates,92,Also_ our work hours have gone down because we've exported most factory labour to sweatshops
559022045489397761,r/teenagers,debates,33,Where hours are ridiculously high
559022127450161172,r/teenagers,debates,49,<@325983451331166208> then people lose their jobs

559022875957395462,r/teenagers,debates,19,if we automate jobs
559022917111906325,r/teenagers,debates,50,Then the tools of automation should not be private
559022934677782558,r/teenagers,debates,21,Because at that point
559023092362641441,r/teenagers,debates,51,with very little labour needed to produce something
