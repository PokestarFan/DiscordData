558834212501979148,75,your solution was to change the texture_ which is what i'm not trying to do
558834640979361802,63,i want to make it so it only renders the side you're looking at
558834676781809665,10,like glass
558834830201192458,3,me?
558834910643748884,43,what would editing the texture do to fix it
558835268434788367,34,i want it to stay semi-transparent
558836743776894977,53,without the pack it actually renders how i want it to
558836782377074699,15,i'm so confused
558837838695759882,37,well that definitely shouldn't happen

558840918619455508,12,currently no
558841025918140437,107,but a pack with the old textures will be released to the store for free in the future <@253632549966839828>
