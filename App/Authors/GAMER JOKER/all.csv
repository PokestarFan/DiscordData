560640097624522752,r/teenagers,memes,1159,WARNING! Carry on reading! Or you will die_ even if you only looked at the word warning! Once there was a little girl called Clarissa_ she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital_ because she killed her mom and her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the government decided that best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her_ as humane as possible_ but it went wrong. The machine they were using went wrong.  She sat there in agony for hours until she died. Now every week_ on the day of her death_ she returns to the person that reads this letterNLOn a Monday night at 12:00 a.m._ she creeps into your room and kills you slowly by cutting you and watching you bleed to death. Now_ send this to ten other discords and she will haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake. Apparently_ if you copy and paste this to ten discords in the next ten minutes_ you will have the best day of your life tomorrow. You will either get kissed or asked out. If you break this chain_ you will see a little dead girl in your room tonight. In 53 minutes someone will say "I love you"_ or "I'm sorry"
