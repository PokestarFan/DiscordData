558835331508600832,461,Hi guys I've got a really hard question. This is for anyone who played in 2012. I remember this really good PVP server I played on where there were huge teams (red and blue i think) and there were tons of maps with some objective i don't really remember. I just remember it was really well organized and the maps were super fun. Tried everything to look it up online but couldn't find any results and figured I'd try here. Let me know if this rings a bell?NL@ me
