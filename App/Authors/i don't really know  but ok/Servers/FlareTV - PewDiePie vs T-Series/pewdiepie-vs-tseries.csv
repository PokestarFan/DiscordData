559090191256649739,12,it's because
559090637979516931,462,PewDiePie have held the first place for many years_ and worked for over 9 years to get to this spot. Now_ some channel nobody knew about is apparently having almost more subscribers than the all-day working_ private person who uses his own money_ to create the content he has and get the subs he have. T-Series is a company and has thousands of thousands of employees which do all the work. NLSo_ basically_ they think T-series didn't deserve the number-one spot.
559090719101419520,24,Hope it explained a bit.
559090766589460510,79,Not saying everyone think that about T-series when they say they don't like it.
559090842103578644,51,It could be racism_ that they suspect sub-bots etc.
559090893110378536,84,Well_ probably to get more people to notice their channel and listen to their music.
559092631490265101,5,uh no
