558868414563614731,21,cancer discord server
558868436613201941,2,:(
558868472076042240,3,yes
558868493173391361,10,esophageal
558868693765980170,136,chemo for 12 weeks_ every 2 weeks I have this bottle hooked up to me while I go anywhere for 2 days_ then 12 days without it and repeat.
558868734509449237,26,I fucking hate this bottle
558868779052957712,32,I am detatched from it right now
558868949547220993,103,it's basically 2 days of attached chemo_ then 12 days of nothing so my white blood cells can regenerate
558868957931765790,11,then repeat
558869018170228736,22,12 weeks_ 6 treamtents
558869069210583040,17,another CAT scana
558869120058392576,28,to compare to the first scan
558869144158601227,27,to see how the cancer looks
558869249188429836,69,all I can say_ is the radiation I was getting has helped tremendously
558869301965225991,11,for example
558869382445400075,71,November_ when I first went to the doctor_ my swallowing was pretty bad
558869427135709205,51,I started radiation in February and it was the same
558869499600961556,75,Radiation affects the tumor directly_ so it was making it inflamed and sore
558869546803658752,56,By the end of radiation I couldn't even eat a french fry
558869593674743808,47,But now_ I can swallow anything without problem
