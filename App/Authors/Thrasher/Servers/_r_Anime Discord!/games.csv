558862076022489115,84,geh finally found a boss that's just become a total utter roadblock I can't overcome
558862166053093406,42,which means it's time to explore elsewhere
558993744830136331,86,hey at least it's looking to be an enhanced version or something and not a racing game
559007121954308102,13,24th of april
559031652219748353,158,if it's some AU story like it could potentially be_ if it's not an enhance version then I guess we don't have to wonder about what platforms it'll come to lol
559031669961523218,22,would be stupid though
559035233366835201,178,>in that selecting the other protagonist you get altered story with changesNLExcept that the changes that are implied for such a route would make you not even be part of the story
559036085833826304,138,it's not a natural progression. There's a difference between making the main character a female and making an entirely different character
