558833599818891325,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,69,truly I feel very confident of netflix's ability to handle evangelion
558833621813690388,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,41,when they put shitty dubstep over footage
558835003274952704,/r/Anime Discord!,games,119,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/280048336981983243/558833877171568656/unknown.png ffxiv concept artists too good

558862076022489115,/r/Anime Discord!,games,84,geh finally found a boss that's just become a total utter roadblock I can't overcome
558862166053093406,/r/Anime Discord!,games,42,which means it's time to explore elsewhere
558993744830136331,/r/Anime Discord!,games,86,hey at least it's looking to be an enhanced version or something and not a racing game
559007121954308102,/r/Anime Discord!,games,13,24th of april
559031652219748353,/r/Anime Discord!,games,158,if it's some AU story like it could potentially be_ if it's not an enhance version then I guess we don't have to wonder about what platforms it'll come to lol
559031669961523218,/r/Anime Discord!,games,22,would be stupid though
559035233366835201,/r/Anime Discord!,games,178,>in that selecting the other protagonist you get altered story with changesNLExcept that the changes that are implied for such a route would make you not even be part of the story
559036085833826304,/r/Anime Discord!,games,138,it's not a natural progression. There's a difference between making the main character a female and making an entirely different character
