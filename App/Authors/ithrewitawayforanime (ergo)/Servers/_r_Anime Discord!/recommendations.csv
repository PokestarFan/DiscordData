558835104357810176,96,<@90537621817655296> nana's anime ending is fine_ it's just the manga that doesnt have an ending

560627130980106250,43,not really "darker"_ but definitely serious
560627562326523915,48,the animation quality of figure 17 is incredible
560627642521616395,58,each episode feels like an OVA_ must've had a large budget
560628118998482984,46,also_ a sci fi mahou shoujo is pretty uncommon
560628261504155699,24,also_ that OP is rockin'

560629939666288651,157,i really don't get to recommend this show enough. in the end_ all mahou shoujos are really about growth and coming of age and that's what Figure 17 does best
560630058968940554,124,the fights and action sequences aren't important_ they're just a plot device to explore the MC as she adapts to her new life
560630117366497332,37,it's really a neat little scifi/drama
