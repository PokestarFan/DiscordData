558439389538287636,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,75,there's enough sexual violence in FR. there doesnt need to be explicit rape
558439644375547915,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,88,gore and explicit violence of any kind are rarely necessary. it's mostly used to be edgy
558834997994192907,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,36,I'll always be another vote for nana
558835104357810176,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,96,<@90537621817655296> nana's anime ending is fine_ it's just the manga that doesnt have an ending
558836140942032907,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,86,the only thing im gonna be disappointed in netflix about is if 7 seeds turns out badly
558838649416974336,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,24,depends on what you like
558838672200433674,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,26,and what youre looking for
558839160832655372,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,72,sounds like erin should be moved up at least to the top half of your ptw
560599232009207851,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,56,hm_ im not familiar with the arts side of education tbh.
560600186854965257,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,85,finding the motivation is hard_ but the key is to not excuse yourself from challenges
560600365834305536,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,162,you know you might be disadvantaged compared to other people your age_ whether its because of financial hardship or whatever else_ so you have to make up for that
560600407743922207,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,56,you have to make up for it by trying harder than they do
560600456791982085,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,24,there's no time to slack
560600784753131550,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,32,it's good to think pragmatically
560600884082507807,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,66,comp sci for programming if that's your goal is an excellent field
560601180837904434,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,24,you cant be afraid of it
560601228820742154,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,34,fear and anxiety must be conquered
560601292142280704,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,31,you aint got time for that shit
560601358856880148,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,53,it's anime as fuck_ but if there's something you want
560601417694314497,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,58,you gotta go and take it by your own blood sweat and tears
560602293582561291,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,1,üëç
560608110637482014,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,108,hate is a strong emotion and hating something that people take as frivolously as birthstones is questionable
560608235254448149,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,27,no you are just contrarian.
560608354162966579,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,67,"i exist on the outside of social norms_ aren't i cool _ notice me"
560626529512456203,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,14,isn't it great
560627102400118785,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,62,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1126/Figure_17__Tsubasa___Hikaru
560627130980106250,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,43,not really "darker"_ but definitely serious
560627562326523915,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,48,the animation quality of figure 17 is incredible
560627642521616395,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,58,each episode feels like an OVA_ must've had a large budget
560628118998482984,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,46,also_ a sci fi mahou shoujo is pretty uncommon
560628261504155699,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,24,also_ that OP is rockin'
560628826216988679,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,28,oh yea_ you're over the hill
560628964343808000,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,43,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZWg94hJ_SQ
560629939666288651,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,157,i really don't get to recommend this show enough. in the end_ all mahou shoujos are really about growth and coming of age and that's what Figure 17 does best
560630058968940554,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,124,the fights and action sequences aren't important_ they're just a plot device to explore the MC as she adapts to her new life
560630117366497332,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,37,it's really a neat little scifi/drama
560634536178876416,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,23,eh_ it's not super edgy
560634577828184064,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,39,there's edge_ but you wont cut yourself
560634679171219456,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,72,it's worth watching if you like action shows with a slightly darker tone
560634833211097114,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,37,honestly it's somewhere in the middle
560634989331611659,/r/Anime Discord!,recommendations,53,i'd say give it a few episodes to decide for yourself
560965164149506058,/r/Anime Discord!,casual,29,hurray for tenured professors
