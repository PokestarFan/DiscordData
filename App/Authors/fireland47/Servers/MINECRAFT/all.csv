561003783048396810,minecraft,23,they exist for a reason
561003908231593994,minecraft,81,you see this game has to appeal to many people not just hardcore and speedrunners

561004345609420808,minecraft,10,see ya man
561004379143012392,minecraft,19,you didnt last long
561004444167438338,minecraft,7,hahahah
561004517689393201,minecraft,23,this aint a meme server
561004577114161152,minecraft,44,go to your 5 dozen other meme servers please
561004718831304715,minecraft,34,are yall thinking what im thinking
561004744391524353,minecraft,10,sky biomes
561004843716575232,minecraft,31,no like very rare cloud islands
561004902994804737,minecraft,46,with rare loot and a new creature defending it
561004937983819826,minecraft,13,endgame stuff
561004968799109121,minecraft,6,elytra
561005095064436750,minecraft,31,whyd you make the berries greed
561005263637970944,minecraft,28,mono the infectious disease?
561005384152776725,minecraft,6,anyway
561005433440174080,minecraft,24,no elytra is for the end
561005472921026561,minecraft,31,probably elytra upgrades though
561005632669483009,minecraft,25,this is all endgame stuff
561005799967555624,minecraft,15,no not too much
561005828526571530,minecraft,34,just a cloud island is good enough
561009003396595712,minecraft,60,i came back to minecraft because of the ocean aquatic update
561009144610422785,minecraft,49,honestly a new way to cross oceans would be great
561009185257553921,minecraft,42,because horses and minecrafts are for land
561009236063289354,minecraft,70,but a new animal that could bring you across the oceans would be great
561009267789004801,minecraft,30,like a horse but for the ocean
561009313125105684,minecraft,28,it doesnt have to be a horse
561009377583300648,minecraft,17,no something real
561009571678912517,minecraft,16,not rideable one
561009629484810240,minecraft,20,skeleton horses sink
561009737148268557,minecraft,52,no something that doesnt bring down the hunger meter
561009783885529098,minecraft,52,like while riding a horse your hunger doesnt go down
561009933878034466,minecraft,28,hey how about a new villager
561009983362433054,minecraft,63,that you pay emeralds for them to bring you to a place by water
561010059837177858,minecraft,11,yes it does
561010138606075914,minecraft,16,they are traders
561010178196242432,minecraft,19,yeah i realize that
561010330638090242,minecraft,27,how about hiring a villager
561010372778262559,minecraft,31,there are villager jobs already
561010481201152000,minecraft,15,not gold though
561010515342786576,minecraft,16,cleric does that
561010712365891585,minecraft,11,or even 1x2
561010794419060747,minecraft,2,no
561010875595751425,minecraft,30,emerald items would be useless
561010909846437890,minecraft,9,like gold
561010969116016641,minecraft,35,you know how no one uses gold armor
561011491604529172,minecraft,39,ok emerald would be weaker than diamond
561011520008486913,minecraft,23,and more rare than iron
561011603516948521,minecraft,28,yeah thats the only good use
561011654859554822,minecraft,38,even if thats replaced by another item
561011684693639209,minecraft,25,there no use for emeralds
561012692031373312,minecraft,18,bedrock is useless
561012756732444715,minecraft,55,just use obsidian if you dont want to destroy something
