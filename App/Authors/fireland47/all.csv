561004937983819826,MINECRAFT,minecraft,13,endgame stuff
561004968799109121,MINECRAFT,minecraft,6,elytra
561005095064436750,MINECRAFT,minecraft,31,whyd you make the berries greed

561005384152776725,MINECRAFT,minecraft,6,anyway
561005433440174080,MINECRAFT,minecraft,24,no elytra is for the end

561005632669483009,MINECRAFT,minecraft,25,this is all endgame stuff
561005799967555624,MINECRAFT,minecraft,15,no not too much
561005828526571530,MINECRAFT,minecraft,34,just a cloud island is good enough
561009003396595712,MINECRAFT,minecraft,60,i came back to minecraft because of the ocean aquatic update
561009144610422785,MINECRAFT,minecraft,49,honestly a new way to cross oceans would be great
561009185257553921,MINECRAFT,minecraft,42,because horses and minecrafts are for land
561009236063289354,MINECRAFT,minecraft,70,but a new animal that could bring you across the oceans would be great
561009267789004801,MINECRAFT,minecraft,30,like a horse but for the ocean
561009313125105684,MINECRAFT,minecraft,28,it doesnt have to be a horse
561009377583300648,MINECRAFT,minecraft,17,no something real
561009571678912517,MINECRAFT,minecraft,16,not rideable one
561009629484810240,MINECRAFT,minecraft,20,skeleton horses sink
561009737148268557,MINECRAFT,minecraft,52,no something that doesnt bring down the hunger meter
561009783885529098,MINECRAFT,minecraft,52,like while riding a horse your hunger doesnt go down
561009933878034466,MINECRAFT,minecraft,28,hey how about a new villager
561009983362433054,MINECRAFT,minecraft,63,that you pay emeralds for them to bring you to a place by water
561010059837177858,MINECRAFT,minecraft,11,yes it does
561010138606075914,MINECRAFT,minecraft,16,they are traders
561010178196242432,MINECRAFT,minecraft,19,yeah i realize that
561010330638090242,MINECRAFT,minecraft,27,how about hiring a villager
561010372778262559,MINECRAFT,minecraft,31,there are villager jobs already
561010481201152000,MINECRAFT,minecraft,15,not gold though
561010515342786576,MINECRAFT,minecraft,16,cleric does that
