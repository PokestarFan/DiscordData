558459556481728543,40,I am badly I can't play it at this state
558459610709753856,49,Its so bad it freezes even on the lowest settings
558460836562337803,13,Yes on switch
558460946797035542,69,Its so bad it actually confuses my switches in game recording feature
558461094080020483,95,When the video gets or the frozen part the bar starts warping then when ur unfreezes its smooth
558461203035324456,4,Yeah
558461297163763715,54,My switch said 14 seconds when the clip was 30 seconds
558461661883924481,100,Until this is fixed I've been playing Nintendo switch edition as I still have that version installed
558468089566461953,7,It does
558468139394793490,37,At first I thought my console crashed
558471555936419880,43,As we speak a legacy pack is in development
558471782105874432,37,Ikr my weak phone has less lag issues
558472045709492236,130,My phone can open the settings instantly but has low frame rate while my switch flat out takes a while 10 seconds to open settings
558472304087269388,105,Compared to how well Nintendo switch edition runs compared to bedrock on switch its obviously a big issue
558472451487694858,118,Even starting the game is different bedrock takes about a minute while switch edition takes 5 seconds or less at times
558472601991905301,4,Yeah
558473100098928640,4,Yeah
558473141702230017,46,It doesn't effect other players in game either
558473188099620889,42,For them you just freeze for a few seconds
558473273273352192,78,They can hit you over and over once you unfreeze you take all the hits at once
558778318086733835,59,Based in my testing the switch lag only happens when docked
558785546676076565,32,I mean a block is technically 3D
