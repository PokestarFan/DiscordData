558117919704219657,MINECRAFT,minecraft,47,Cave game was actually pretty fun to go back to
558459556481728543,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,40,I am badly I can't play it at this state
558459610709753856,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,49,Its so bad it freezes even on the lowest settings

558460946797035542,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,69,Its so bad it actually confuses my switches in game recording feature

558472045709492236,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,130,My phone can open the settings instantly but has low frame rate while my switch flat out takes a while 10 seconds to open settings
558472304087269388,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,105,Compared to how well Nintendo switch edition runs compared to bedrock on switch its obviously a big issue
