558431825719197735,serious-general,124,Don't you love it when you casually put in 8x the baking powder called for in a recipe and you can't start over because time
558443064700567555,serious-general,13,Brownies lmao
558443153825202206,serious-general,63,I put in 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead of 1/2 a teaspoon
558443181390168105,serious-general,24,Now they're super puffed
558443355848048650,serious-general,0,
558443428363632641,serious-general,35,It was less than halfway up the pan
558443545665470477,serious-general,28,Idk I haven't tried them yet
558444042636099640,serious-general,4,no u
558444140044484608,serious-general,51,I can't eat them because they're for class tomorrow
558444267337678858,serious-general,35,These ones are the gluten free ones
558444315873902604,serious-general,50,I tried the gluten ones and they taste pretty good
558444369644879911,serious-general,56,But the gluten ones also don't have 8x the baking powder
558444483692331014,serious-general,9,I hope so
558444519511556106,serious-general,29,At least it isn't baking soda
558444574503337986,serious-general,46,That stuff will make things taste like pretzel
558444754350637057,serious-general,7,Oh dear
558444806041501716,serious-general,51,I just tried cutting them and the middle is all raw
558445062128926720,serious-general,14,I don't really
558445078117613576,serious-general,14,Or ingredients
558445306035830830,serious-general,48,That's what I'm gonna do hopefully it won't burn
558445917171220512,serious-general,67,\*wants to be a baker\*NL\*puts 8x the baking powder in the batter\*
558446109534584834,serious-general,24,Lots of rinsing probably
558446142409539600,serious-general,28,With as hot as you can stand
558446210625830923,serious-general,39,It might be on your hands at this point
558446254468759573,serious-general,47,I assume you don't want to just shampoo it out?
558446386392203294,serious-general,34,It'll probably take multiple times
558446421725151242,serious-general,29,Pure oil is some greasy stuff
558446647273586700,serious-general,112,Idk I'm a guy who's had like at most 2 inch hair until recently_ when I tried growing it to like *gasp* 3 inches
558446858641604618,serious-general,73,I have natural shampoo that has coconut in it_ you could try that instead
558446934751445024,serious-general,51,It's just the suave natural shampoo and conditioner
558446965654814752,serious-general,30,It's not very expensive either
558461345474019328,serious-general,7,*Yikes*
558461413350440961,serious-general,25,What happened after that?
558461584389963789,serious-general,40,My brownies were ruined from 2 teaspoons
558467747122511873,serious-general,19,*laughs in asexual*
558468085015773225,serious-general,103,The thing about me is that I'm only ace_ not aro so I want a relationship but just with no sex involved
558468125658447873,serious-general,36,Kinda hard to find someone like that
558468170281648138,serious-general,12,At least irl
558468236987858995,serious-general,57,I don't know how to explain it well_ but aro is aromantic
558468404110032896,serious-general,134,I've never been able to explain it succesfully_ but its like all the romance stuff is all just seen as pointless from my understanding
558468678677692416,serious-general,149,I felt a brief understanding of it earlier_ if any of y'all have ever read the inheritance cycle_ Arya and Eragon's relationship just had me confused
558468726643752981,serious-general,57,Thats the closest I've been to understanding aromanticism
558468773716426768,serious-general,8,Yeah her
558468814329610250,serious-general,17,No arya is an elf
558468874253893633,serious-general,45,Eragon is something else_ aragorn is lotr tho
558468926585962537,serious-general,4,Yeet
558469104839819276,serious-general,56,But anyway_ I was listening to it earlier and being like
558469121361182727,serious-general,16,wtf is happening
558469260272336896,serious-general,75,"He caressed her tender skin" "He noticed her shapely form" like??? what???
558469522885967882,serious-general,84,There was other stuff too like "[go fight] for my sake]" after like just meeting her
558469562509819924,serious-general,15,Eragon was yeah
558469656097062913,serious-general,92,I secretly think he wrote those scenes to project himself onto what he thought love would be
558469689282658324,serious-general,44,Then realized that it just was not like that
558469805569605633,serious-general,13,*What movie?*
558469826201255937,serious-general,17,*Theres no movie*

558469973987819540,serious-general,24,There is no eragon movie
558470031177023488,serious-general,35,The lotr movies were pretty alright
558470110403100693,serious-general,113,I haven't seen them in a while and I haven't even read the books but it was about as confusing as star wars to me
558470200295424040,serious-general,60,But then again I'm just a dumbass when it comes to star wars
558470282248192001,serious-general,24,I just can't get into it
558470296429133844,serious-general,9,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
558470340322263061,serious-general,28,I've tried but its just oike
558470376120778752,serious-general,26,this isn't science fiction
558470407750025226,serious-general,50,This is space fantasy trying to be science fiction
558470670191951882,serious-general,86,*all my friends* are fucking walking star wars encyclopdedias and I'm just like uh huh

558472704433455114,serious-general,118,throwback to when 12 year old me thought it would be a dandy idea to write a mario fanfic on the fucking iOS notes app
558472925099851811,serious-general,32,At least it wasn't a ship fanfic
558473027659235368,serious-general,50,Little ace me didn't know what wanting to fuck was
