558453319157153812,multiplayer,593,Welcome to Triton! A government run minecraft server - sounds messed_ but good in the long run. Minecraft Survival_ but with laws_ and a council to be voted in and decide things. We have a currency called Tbux_ it can be used to buy things in a capitalist society_ we try not to have politics play too much of a role to ensure your enjoyment of the server. Our Capital is Bloxtown VIII. We allow other countries to be made by giving up a portion of our own land. There are currently 3 districts: Bloxtown VIII_ Tritonian Wing Region_ Tritonian Infinity. DM <@291953700367499275> if interested.
