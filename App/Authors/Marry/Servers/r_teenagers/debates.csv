558427651358982154,134,<@!386340686095450112> Your obsession with torturing murderers and rapists goes less from â€˜unjustâ€™ and more into â€˜sadisticâ€™ territory.
558427778735931392,20,It achieves nothing.
558427841684045835,49,Itâ€™s just the â€˜satisfactionâ€™ of torturing people.
558428824623120384,32,Hakenkreuz is used by the Nazis.
558430424830050305,17,Whatâ€™s the topic?
558430618724073483,64,I donâ€™t know enough about gun control to make a wise conclusion.
558432751540240385,120,<@!386340686095450112> I get that itâ€™s good to have specific topics that you know off the back of your hand_ but_ câ€™mon.
558432796297920533,48,Itâ€™s gotta be something that people disagree on.
558432844020449291,52,Most people agree that Chinaâ€™s a pretty bad country.
558433194605805588,37,Iâ€™m pinging a frat boy if he does it.
558433280060293120,1,ðŸ—¿
558433367637622784,32,Sweaty be like_ always watching.
558433441809432597,23,Happy birthday_ Sweaty.
558433619811500089,70,To each their own_ itâ€™s like when people say that others have no life.
558433675109335051,78,I donâ€™t know what their life is like_ I donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re going through.
558763433361932329,4,Epic
558763443688046593,14,I love Mueller
558763455524634624,17,For the most part
558801354357735444,70,Nickel took my sources instead of just linking the Guttmacher reports.
558801373542612992,11,Disgusting.
558834084923834368,108,This channelâ€™s fine when there are people who:NLa) Read sources that others provide.NLb) Provide good sources.
558834105488375808,27,Otherwise_ itâ€™s a shitshow.
558834254763786240,82,Preferably_ the original studies done. Ones not then taken and skewed by articles.
558834377937649665,64,Thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t like Nickel using all of my sources earlier.
558834519356997640,116,I got them when I was looking through it_ but the Guttmacher reports are some of the only solid studies on abortion.
558834710063611949,21,<#270775140172824588>
558834740900134923,21,Thatâ€™s not the point.
558834828909346820,91,The Guttmacher reports detail how laws regarding abortion affect little_ for the most part.
558834916536614912,116,Fair enough. I prefer debates that discuss whether abortion should be outlawed rather than ones saying itâ€™s immoral.
558835140076240896,11,Pro-choice.
558835197374758942,64,Because_ past everything_ abortion laws are basically worthless.
558835543010574338,95,Unorthodox abortion_ yes. But nowadays_ pills basically mean that laws are pissing in the wind.
558835820593807371,15,No_ not always.
558835836624568351,21,I came here a socdem.
558835854655881216,20,Iâ€™m now a communist.
558836041944137729,52,Do you believe that the USSR was communist_ comrade?
558836060755329069,32,Because thatâ€™s always fun to do.
558836257627570187,21,Dodging the question.
558836289852538881,56,<@!378627967435145219> Hey_ it still backs up the point.
558836367178858516,97,People change when theyâ€™re willing to participate in debate instead of exclaiming their thoughts.
558836452008525824,31,As in_ the ideals of communism?
558836474162970634,28,Or how it would be achieved?
558836608368115713,76,Three main forms of achieving communism. Revolution_ revisionism_ reformism.
558836645571461130,44,Revolution is_ well_ proletarian revolution.
558836721907662878,95,Revisionism is shit_ itâ€™s basically revising aspects of communism to make it easier to achieve.
558836825008111616,96,Reformism is what most tried to do_ where you often go from cap to socdem/statcap to soc to com.
558836875545280518,46,In the USSR_ it was due to the effects of WWI.
558837032542011392,188,The economy remained too damaged to maintain a dictatorship of the proletariat_ so Lenin implemented state capitalism in the hopes that they could restore the economy before going forward.
558837072929095682,30,However_ this fucked up badly.
558837290638639154,168,Khrushchev did the numbers and guessed that communism could be achieved in 20 years; however_ Brezhnevâ€™s reign resulted in the Era of Stagnation_ which doomed the USSR.
558837444607475733,40,Khrushchevism was just de-Stalinisation.
558837518200471556,51,Khrushchev was a rather ineffective leader_ though.
558837769275834368,56,Youâ€™ve gotta note that they attempted reformism_ though.
558837872308781058,52,Places such as RevCat came close through revolution.
558837951723864079,100,The USSR is a strange case. The revolution achieved basically nothing_ so Lenin turned to reformism.
558838093952843787,34,Stalinist policies were atrocious.
558838136940003346,74,I could see what he was aiming for (state socialism)_ but itâ€™s ridiculous.
558838228354990090,5,Yeah.
558838307660759041,111,A big issue was that the leaders of the USSR basically tried to repeal each previous leader_ for the most part.
558838465064861716,102,Khrushchev and de-Stalinisation. Andropov turned against Brezhnev. Gorbachev condemned Soviet leaders.
558838516784693263,20,Socdem is... flimsy.
558838882402304010,71,Shame how the USSR turned into a degenerated workersâ€™ state so quickly.
558839163672199198,47,Russia relies heavily on the petrodollar_ IIRC.
558839221553594368,47,Which is why its place in BRIC is questionable.
558839446875799582,6,BRICS?
558839470384742432,24,Iâ€™ve only heard of BRIC.
558839689432530945,78,Brazil_ Russia_ India_ China. Four countries that have emerging markets_ IIRC.
558839708512288795,13,South Africa?
558839729097932810,35,Didnâ€™t hear that it had been added.
558839785997860879,90,I know that Indonesia started getting considered a while back but still hasnâ€™t been added.
558839824795041803,33,Damn. Cheers for letting me know.
558839920731357214,26,Turkey_ sure_ makes sense.
558839931858845696,11,But_ Egypt?
558839939257729034,7,Really?
558840024808947712,32,Do they specialise in something?
558840207663693874,6,Whack.
558840343475388427,66,Is Saudi Arabia considered emerging or developed by our standards?
558840502649094155,95,It feels like it lies outside our listings_ due to the disparity between the rich and the poor.
558840534966468608,40,You find it throughout the Arab nations.
558840574682333184,19,Well_ some of them.
558849550933164032,143,IIRC_ INTERPOL found that thereâ€™s around 45_000 ISIS members worldwide? And Stock said that the ISIS threat will grow when the caliphate falls?
558850474636345348,87,Do any of you remember when ISIS destroyed what was assumed to be Jonahâ€™s tomb in 2014?
558850500481777705,13,Strange move.
559007437340803074,101,Thatâ€™s just the caliphate. IIRC_ Interpol believes that thereâ€™s still about 45_000 members worldwide.
