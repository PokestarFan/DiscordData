558427778735931392,r/teenagers,debates,20,It achieves nothing.
558427841684045835,r/teenagers,debates,49,Itâ€™s just the â€˜satisfactionâ€™ of torturing people.
558428824623120384,r/teenagers,debates,32,Hakenkreuz is used by the Nazis.

558763455524634624,r/teenagers,debates,17,For the most part
558801354357735444,r/teenagers,debates,70,Nickel took my sources instead of just linking the Guttmacher reports.
558801373542612992,r/teenagers,debates,11,Disgusting.
558834084923834368,r/teenagers,debates,108,This channelâ€™s fine when there are people who:NLa) Read sources that others provide.NLb) Provide good sources.
558834105488375808,r/teenagers,debates,27,Otherwise_ itâ€™s a shitshow.
558834254763786240,r/teenagers,debates,82,Preferably_ the original studies done. Ones not then taken and skewed by articles.
558834377937649665,r/teenagers,debates,64,Thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t like Nickel using all of my sources earlier.
558834519356997640,r/teenagers,debates,116,I got them when I was looking through it_ but the Guttmacher reports are some of the only solid studies on abortion.
558834710063611949,r/teenagers,debates,21,<#270775140172824588>
558834740900134923,r/teenagers,debates,21,Thatâ€™s not the point.
558834828909346820,r/teenagers,debates,91,The Guttmacher reports detail how laws regarding abortion affect little_ for the most part.
558834916536614912,r/teenagers,debates,116,Fair enough. I prefer debates that discuss whether abortion should be outlawed rather than ones saying itâ€™s immoral.
558835140076240896,r/teenagers,debates,11,Pro-choice.
558835197374758942,r/teenagers,debates,64,Because_ past everything_ abortion laws are basically worthless.
558835543010574338,r/teenagers,debates,95,Unorthodox abortion_ yes. But nowadays_ pills basically mean that laws are pissing in the wind.
558835820593807371,r/teenagers,debates,15,No_ not always.
558835836624568351,r/teenagers,debates,21,I came here a socdem.

558836060755329069,r/teenagers,debates,32,Because thatâ€™s always fun to do.
558836257627570187,r/teenagers,debates,21,Dodging the question.
558836289852538881,r/teenagers,debates,56,<@!378627967435145219> Hey_ it still backs up the point.
558836367178858516,r/teenagers,debates,97,People change when theyâ€™re willing to participate in debate instead of exclaiming their thoughts.
558836452008525824,r/teenagers,debates,31,As in_ the ideals of communism?
558836474162970634,r/teenagers,debates,28,Or how it would be achieved?
558836608368115713,r/teenagers,debates,76,Three main forms of achieving communism. Revolution_ revisionism_ reformism.
558836645571461130,r/teenagers,debates,44,Revolution is_ well_ proletarian revolution.
558836721907662878,r/teenagers,debates,95,Revisionism is shit_ itâ€™s basically revising aspects of communism to make it easier to achieve.
558836825008111616,r/teenagers,debates,96,Reformism is what most tried to do_ where you often go from cap to socdem/statcap to soc to com.
558836875545280518,r/teenagers,debates,46,In the USSR_ it was due to the effects of WWI.
558837032542011392,r/teenagers,debates,188,The economy remained too damaged to maintain a dictatorship of the proletariat_ so Lenin implemented state capitalism in the hopes that they could restore the economy before going forward.
558837072929095682,r/teenagers,debates,30,However_ this fucked up badly.
558837290638639154,r/teenagers,debates,168,Khrushchev did the numbers and guessed that communism could be achieved in 20 years; however_ Brezhnevâ€™s reign resulted in the Era of Stagnation_ which doomed the USSR.
558837444607475733,r/teenagers,debates,40,Khrushchevism was just de-Stalinisation.
558837518200471556,r/teenagers,debates,51,Khrushchev was a rather ineffective leader_ though.
558837769275834368,r/teenagers,debates,56,Youâ€™ve gotta note that they attempted reformism_ though.
558837872308781058,r/teenagers,debates,52,Places such as RevCat came close through revolution.
558837951723864079,r/teenagers,debates,100,The USSR is a strange case. The revolution achieved basically nothing_ so Lenin turned to reformism.
558838093952843787,r/teenagers,debates,34,Stalinist policies were atrocious.
558838136940003346,r/teenagers,debates,74,I could see what he was aiming for (state socialism)_ but itâ€™s ridiculous.
558838228354990090,r/teenagers,debates,5,Yeah.
558838307660759041,r/teenagers,debates,111,A big issue was that the leaders of the USSR basically tried to repeal each previous leader_ for the most part.
558838465064861716,r/teenagers,debates,102,Khrushchev and de-Stalinisation. Andropov turned against Brezhnev. Gorbachev condemned Soviet leaders.
558838516784693263,r/teenagers,debates,20,Socdem is... flimsy.
558838882402304010,r/teenagers,debates,71,Shame how the USSR turned into a degenerated workersâ€™ state so quickly.
558839163672199198,r/teenagers,debates,47,Russia relies heavily on the petrodollar_ IIRC.
558839221553594368,r/teenagers,debates,47,Which is why its place in BRIC is questionable.
558839446875799582,r/teenagers,debates,6,BRICS?
558839470384742432,r/teenagers,debates,24,Iâ€™ve only heard of BRIC.

558839729097932810,r/teenagers,debates,35,Didnâ€™t hear that it had been added.
558839785997860879,r/teenagers,debates,90,I know that Indonesia started getting considered a while back but still hasnâ€™t been added.
558839824795041803,r/teenagers,debates,33,Damn. Cheers for letting me know.
558839920731357214,r/teenagers,debates,26,Turkey_ sure_ makes sense.

558839939257729034,r/teenagers,debates,7,Really?
558840024808947712,r/teenagers,debates,32,Do they specialise in something?
558840207663693874,r/teenagers,debates,6,Whack.
558840343475388427,r/teenagers,debates,66,Is Saudi Arabia considered emerging or developed by our standards?
558840502649094155,r/teenagers,debates,95,It feels like it lies outside our listings_ due to the disparity between the rich and the poor.
558840534966468608,r/teenagers,debates,40,You find it throughout the Arab nations.
558840574682333184,r/teenagers,debates,19,Well_ some of them.
558849550933164032,r/teenagers,debates,143,IIRC_ INTERPOL found that thereâ€™s around 45_000 ISIS members worldwide? And Stock said that the ISIS threat will grow when the caliphate falls?
558850474636345348,r/teenagers,debates,87,Do any of you remember when ISIS destroyed what was assumed to be Jonahâ€™s tomb in 2014?
558850500481777705,r/teenagers,debates,13,Strange move.
559007437340803074,r/teenagers,debates,101,Thatâ€™s just the caliphate. IIRC_ Interpol believes that thereâ€™s still about 45_000 members worldwide.
