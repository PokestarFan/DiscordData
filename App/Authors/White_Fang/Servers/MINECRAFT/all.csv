558427950287028231,minecraft,171,Personally I'd think only volcanoes should spawn in the nether. Meteors should not be added unless it is already on the ground_ and pre-generated_ like a village or temple
558428030314479627,minecraft,30,<@!209861974102638592> I agree
558428072005599244,minecraft,26,<@!319907948229033985> Lol
558428191522291712,minecraft,96,As Helen once put it everybody; they won't add something if it is not preventable by the player.
558428453029019684,minecraft,179,<@!209861974102638592> But lightning actually doing damage to something is so rare unless summoned by a player when it is not raining and the lightning can actually burn something
558428546746548224,minecraft,38,<@400845675371298836> I mean_ possibly
558428775969325105,minecraft,167,<@!209861974102638592> I agree_ that would be nice. Come up upon a mountain_ find it is a volcano_ it is an inactive volcano_ that would be cool. Nice place to explore
558429060842127380,minecraft,125,<@!209861974102638592> Yes_ that'd be nice. From the inactive volcano areas_ so we both have a new block and a new generation
558429126873055233,minecraft,26,I'd fully support of that.
558429353713860663,minecraft,54,<@!282716043867062272> It is Jesus_ it can not die lol
558429754802307073,minecraft,205,Also_ these are my ideas on updates that should be added:NLNLSome new ores possibly_ can be elaborated on.NLA volcano possibly (inactive though_ or in the nether)NLWe. Need. Actual. Birds. In. Minecraft. Pl0x.

559035425889452043,minecraft,42,These lanterns are perfect for the tunnels
559035538313838612,minecraft,117,<@255147883941068811> You can usually find them in rivers and lakes and along ocean edges and island edges underwater
559038125738033172,minecraft,23,Look at the tiny salmon
559038445490667538,minecraft,116,Do you think I should build a fence above this fence lining the edge and put lanterns hanging from the higher fence?

559038739603521556,minecraft,91,<@!338579309205913600> I know what to do for the lighting for the edge of the bridge though
