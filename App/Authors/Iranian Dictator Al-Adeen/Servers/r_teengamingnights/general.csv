558809901489717278,1568,CHAPTER 1: This is a story about a young boy called OverFast. OverFast liked to play Minecraft on the internet with old men. One day OverFast applied to be a moderator on a minecraft server. He did this to impress a girl who had asked him to prom. He went into school the next day and said over lunch_ “Hey Emily” (that was the name of the girl)_ “Guess what? I’m a moderator now”. Emily’s jaw dropped. “A…. a moderator? Of what?” OverFast replied confidently “A Minecraft Server with over 100 active members of course” “Oh…. Wow. Wow.” Emily said_ her heart racing “I know I said I would wait until marriage but this… this is big news. Did I ever tell you how attractive you are_ OverFast?” “Wait what?” Came a voice from the table behind them. “You’re a mod on a server with over 100 active players?”This was the voice of Kaitlyn Johnson_ the most popular cheerleader in school. Every boy was head over heels in love with her_ she had blonde hair and always wore very short skirts. “I sure am”_ OverFast replied_ his chest pushed outwards with pride. “I am able to do roll backs and look into people’s inventorys” “Jesus Christ. Meet me in the art classroom in five minutes” Now while OverFast had only had limited success with the opposite sex before_ he wasn’t at all surprised about all the new attention he was getting. Emily held his hand all the way to the art classroom. There was no way she was going to miss out on an opportunity like this. How many girls get to go out with a moderator_ let alone date one? She couldn’t let Kaitlyn Johnson steal him away..
558809949669425173,1564,CHAPTER 2: Emily held her breath as OverFast opened the door to the art classroom. Inside was Kaitlyn Johnson with a disgusted look on her face. “Back off bitch_ this moderator is mine” she snarled at Emily “You’re such a gold digger Kaitlyn” Emily replied_ “I liked him even before he was a tier three donator. You’re sooo shallow” OverFast retorted wittily “Calm down girls_ I can just date both of you at the same time” To be continued..NLNLCHAPTER 3: The next couple of days were a blur. Countless girls were giving OverFast their snaps_ he had to use his super quick moderator typing skills to keep up with it all. Countless picture after picture flooding his dms_ OverFast was spending hours each day going through all of them. The next week_ OverFast was walking down the hall towards his locker_ high-fiving every guy that passed him and winking at all the girls. He started putting his book back into his locker when he heard a shout come from behind him. “Hey_ hey OverFast! Is this allowed?” The voice belonged a young freshman called Theo. Ever since OverFast became a mod Theo had been spending a lot of time with OverFast. “Well technically Theo you’re not allowed to run in the halls_ but you won’t get expelled for it” “Oh okay. Hey OverFast! Hey OverFast! Can you hear me? Can I go chat to Will in this classroom?” “Theo_ that door is locked” “Yeah_ but I know a way in – if I hit this kid I’ll be able to force my way in_ it’s really cool” “Don’t do that _ don’t do that that’s expellable” “Fine” Theo sighed as he turned away towards the cafeteria
558810053541625858,1105,OverFast was just about to turn away to go have lunch with Emily_ when he saw a neatly folded piece of paper in his locker that he didn’t recognise. In small handwriting it read “Hey_ you probably don’t know me_ I probably don’t exist for you but I think you’re really cool” OverFast had never seen a message like this before_ Sure_ in the last week his newfound status as a moderator had persuaded a lot of girls to send him pictures_ but a hand written note? That was new… There was a tug on OverFast’s shirt sleeve. A girl was standing there. She waved_ pointed at herself and then ran away down the corridor_ without having said a word. “Hey OverFast. Who was that?” Emily said_ having just turned the corner towards OverFast’s locker. Emily was wearing short shorts and had a very tight crop top on. She was definitely looking for OverFast's attention. “I don’t know…” OverFast replied_ staring down the corrido the girl had run away down. “Anyway_ it’s time we had lunch together. I have something I want to show you. In private.” Emily grabbed OverFast’s hand and marched him towards the cafeteria.
558810106117226518,1602,CHAPTER 4: Emily was sat opposite OverFast in the cafeteria_ intensely looking into his eyes as he ate his egg sandwich. “What do you want Emily?” OverFast asked her_ tearing his eyes away from the girl that put the note into his locker.He was wondering if he should have gone over and said hello as she was sat all alone_ not talking to anyone. “Aren’t you going to ask what I was wanted to tell you?” Emily replied slyly_ twirling her hair. “Okay fine_ what were you going to tell me?” Emily burst out laughing “Oh OverFast you’re so funny. Have I ever told you that? I’m sure I have. Oh have you been working lately? You’re the strongest man I know under five foot seven. Anyway_ I wanted to ask if you’d ever thought about having kids before. Look I’m going to say something and I want to hear what you have to say about it. We should have kids as soon as possible. Look_ I’m a virgin_ you’re almost definitely a virgin but ever since you became a moderator on that minecraft server… I don’t know everything feels different. If you want to..” “Hey everyone! There’s a fight going on outside!” Emily’s proposal was cut short as the whole of the school piled out of the cafeteria to catch a glimpse of the brawl going on outside. “Whatcha going to do headass? Huh? You gonna try and run away?” Just outside the parking lot a circle had formed around a 6’4 beast of boy annihilating a tiny freshman. “Please leave me alone” the boy cried “I just joined this school” “I was tryna get to class and you got in my way. So I took my space back_ that’s how capitalism works” the hulking boy snarled.(edited)
558810131505086484,577,“BREAK THIS UP NOW” Heads turned as an aged man with wispy tufts of white hair and a walking stick tottered towards the circle. This man was the principal_ known to the students as NSA (a name he earnt for his inescapable watch over the school). “This is a violence free zone" NSA said calmy_ "o8f_ get off of him NOW. Follow me to my office.” “Wow_ OverFast_ we wouldn’t let our kid get away with this right?” Emily asked_ turning to OverFast. No reply came. OverFast had already left the parking lot_ walking quickly back to the cafeteria_ and more importantly the note girl.
