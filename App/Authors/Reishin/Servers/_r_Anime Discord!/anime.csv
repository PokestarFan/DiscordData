558834715780579329,30,<:waitwhat:490350733951238174>
558835065182879744,38,so you're trying to revive a dead meme
558835112037580821,63,that's necromancy and qualifies as a violation of weeaboo codex
558835202814902309,3,hmm
558840638599200769,81,Don't judge book by its cover.NLNLBut anime isn't a book. Judge anime by its cover.

558850777599311872,82,Don't you guys get disappointed when mediocre/ok-ish anime has god tier soundtrack
558850889650012182,68,like Fairy Tail's soundtrack is in a higher league than anime itself
558850907035533332,33,<:feelsvoiman:529569461523709953>
558851375115534337,60,best Fairy Tail characters are Jellal_ Siegrain and Mystogan
558851389384556544,27,<:haHAA:529569462676881438>
558851522662891530,72,seriously though_ this music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQJDaNXZ2As
558851651310583809,24,yeah but this is kickass
558851723188502529,25,mystogan's theme is great
558851746844114952,33,but Jellal's one is just hardcore
558851818877222924,43,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBhF28Ynj9U
558851827513163779,11,here you go
558851897042403329,15,non spoiler pic
558852004827627551,23,mist gun the great dude
558852203499225088,27,<:haHAA:529569462676881438>
558852241910661130,30,>sees headbandNL>Must be naruto
558852301830225921,27,also Naruto has great music
558852309417721884,3,too
558852322730573838,2,ah
558852368418996254,4,lmao
558852581309284362,28,best fox in anime hands down
558852598858252304,14,and tails down
558852690906578944,3,hmm
558852756245577739,21,Naruto ripped of life
558852776537489410,38,so everything feels like Naruto ripoff
558852818522341376,11,except JoJo
558852889125191690,32,because JoJo ripped off universe
558853138111528970,65,would Fairy Tail even have been that popular if not for the music
558853155639525447,1,ðŸ¤”
558853184727154698,30,well I guess manga was popular
558853207078731783,33,<:feelsvoiman:529569461523709953>
558853331003637760,33,just listen to the soundtrack tbh
558853380445831198,41,would rather watch 20 other quality anime
558853465854574593,42,I;d recommend watching it for fun casually
558853495822745611,12,dont rush it
558853505582891009,9,not worth
558853659040153622,103,only thing I can surely say is good about FT is soundtrack and everything related to Jellal's character
558853844440842262,15,fights are lame
558853865684860930,26,no choreography just fists
558854069561589771,38,but FT is still fun_ despite the flaws
558854097256710155,9,Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
558854204568109056,66,~~if we dont count all the screentime spent on characters crying~~
558854395077459969,29,<:mistake:529569462492332032>
558854740725989405,19,time to watch sleep
558854778914865152,6,sleep*
558854845319348235,46,I've been scrolling anime list for 2 hours now
558854946112405504,59,didn't have will to even watch the show I started yesterday
