558849325162299398,47,so what are scheduled tikes for the EU tourney?
559002150986973204,212,I discovered VoxelMaps full screen map feature. I did a stripmine and it turns out that mining 1 block forward marks roughly 200 around you on the map_ could be easier to map out the server than using actual maps
559002208818036736,36,can’t display the map in game though
559002322718556160,115,an advantage of the full screen map though is that it tells you the co ordinates of whichever bit your cursor is on
559002687530598420,171,<@428493468088664064> I don’t know what you mean by very large_ but I saw a fairly big ocean around the town with Norwegian flags in front of their temple_ I think it’s Z+
