558849325162299398,r/teengamingnights,general,47,so what are scheduled tikes for the EU tourney?
558856351518949387,r/teengamingnights,trading,55,still selling my blaze rods btw if anyone is interested
559002150986973204,r/teengamingnights,general,212,I discovered VoxelMaps full screen map feature. I did a stripmine and it turns out that mining 1 block forward marks roughly 200 around you on the map_ could be easier to map out the server than using actual maps
559002208818036736,r/teengamingnights,general,36,can’t display the map in game though
559002322718556160,r/teengamingnights,general,115,an advantage of the full screen map though is that it tells you the co ordinates of whichever bit your cursor is on
559002687530598420,r/teengamingnights,general,171,<@428493468088664064> I don’t know what you mean by very large_ but I saw a fairly big ocean around the town with Norwegian flags in front of their temple_ I think it’s Z+
559003955531612180,r/teengamingnights,general,12,Wait really?
559010352839524365,r/teengamingnights,general,98,<@261572140082397185> no I mean you can’t display it like a map wall. I can display it ingame fine
559062581369896961,r/teengamingnights,general,34,apparently lightning is happening?
