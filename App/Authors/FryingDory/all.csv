558819828396326944,r/teengamingnights,reports,715,The player dixonjazz lured me with a shulker box trade. He offered to trade one shulker box for diamonds. I followed him to his store in the nether hub and he placed a bed_ costing me a totem. This breaks this rule: (c. Scamming other players with in-game deals or services is strictly forbidden. Do not make transactions you cannot actually fulfill your part of the deal in.) as dixon could never fullfill his part in the trade. Someone else_ presumably helping him_ then bombed me a second time which breaks the following rule: (f. Players intentionally aiding others in breaking the rules will be equally punished for the actions of the people they are aiding.) If possible_ I would like the two totems used back
