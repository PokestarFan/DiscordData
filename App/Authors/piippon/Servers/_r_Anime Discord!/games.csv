558760913340203010,114,<@203992091095728129> boss ||wire granny was hella intense_ yeah|| goddamn the bosses have been so much fun so far
558783674439565322,101,just beat it too ||you can literally just unlimited sprint around him for the entirety of the fight||
558783726973091853,72,||I feel like I missed some gimmick to it because that was kinda silly||
558783761018388480,3,yes
558783993181372446,7,why not
558784022692757536,38,some of the greatest games of all time
558784264565686291,52,that just makes them so much more satisfying to beat
558784369192468490,79,start with the first dark souls_ it's arguably the slowest and easiest to learn
558784599178739758,34,3 throws you right in the deep end
558784631235805210,44,I'd say the hardest first boss in the series
558784858407567422,17,was 1 your first?
558784925638197249,47,the first souls you play is usually the hardest
558785009377607705,3,sad
558785112867864577,99,having played all of em extensively (starting with 1) I think 1 is honestly the easiest of them all
558785144362631179,45,so easy to cheese too from a very early stage
558785202047156224,63,or not cheese_ but easy to get a super strong setup really fast
558785333924462595,87,and it's by far the slowest save for DeS_ but DeS has far longer and unforgiving levels
558786093684883459,35,really? it's just one enemy to kill
558786174362189849,68,or two_ if you wanna stealth stab the first guy inside the boss room
558786407896973359,4,yeah
558786464209436675,20,never happened to me
558786599870136323,97,stay on the roofs until just before the hammer dues and then just sprint along the righthand wall
558786641863376897,24,dogs shouldnt even aggro
558786711874961418,36,I actually like most of the runbacks
558786758767017994,53,makes me feel like a ninja flying across the rooftops
558797459548274702,189,I don't remember who was having trouble earlier with boss ||the spear dude at the tower from the prologue|| but I just found a way to get to that fight without aggroing a single other enemy
558797476295868446,23,so you can 1v1 in peace
558803918625439754,153,can I just say how motherfucking satisfying it is to fight a (mini)boss so many times you eventually learn to combo its entire posture bar down in one go
558806251790925834,100,so far the only real difference between "mini"bosses and bosses is that the latter give achievements
558806829107380229,235,I have a general tip about the combat btw if anyone wants_ realizing this made it really click with me finally: ||never stop getting in people's faces_ you have unlimited stamina for a reason_ keep relentlessly attacking all the time||
558807039829344256,139,||you can usually wail on them until they parry you_ at which point you can usually parry their counter and then keep comboing after that||
558808589335265290,92,I've realized you *really* need to learn it if you want to be successful at anything_ really
558808746701094912,126,in souls it's a special move that makes some enemies far more effective and easier to beat_ but here it's absolutely essential
