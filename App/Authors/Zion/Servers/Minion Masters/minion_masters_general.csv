560602382724235264,166,Eh.  It depends for me.  If it's an actually close game then yeah_ long or short_ I consider it legit.  If it's the enemy inducing Healing Cancer though_ not so much.
560631315049742342,74,I wonder if Screaming Scrat can hit the Tower if you use Netherstep on it.

560631497112027136,91,It's technically on the ground_ and Screaming Scrat hits all ground enemies upon exploding.
560631914697064450,44,Yeah_ only one explosion_ then he's useless.
560632049178902552,31,Also_ has anyone seen this yet:
560632260198662155,59,I waited over a month for it. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560632325210374154,44,I hoarded the gold just so I could get this.
560632568706367489,22,Still worth it for me.
560632920117739530,51,I guess you could call it a personal status symbol.

560633624366415892,99,That'd probably be the Supreme Arenas worth Rubies.  The Treasure Vault has always been Gold based.
560633882202865664,33,The Classic Arena?  Got that too.
