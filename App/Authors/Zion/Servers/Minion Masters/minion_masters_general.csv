560602382724235264,166,Eh.  It depends for me.  If it's an actually close game then yeah_ long or short_ I consider it legit.  If it's the enemy inducing Healing Cancer though_ not so much.
560631315049742342,74,I wonder if Screaming Scrat can hit the Tower if you use Netherstep on it.

560631497112027136,91,It's technically on the ground_ and Screaming Scrat hits all ground enemies upon exploding.
560631914697064450,44,Yeah_ only one explosion_ then he's useless.
560632049178902552,31,Also_ has anyone seen this yet:
560632260198662155,59,I waited over a month for it. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560632325210374154,44,I hoarded the gold just so I could get this.
560632568706367489,22,Still worth it for me.
560632920117739530,51,I guess you could call it a personal status symbol.

560633624366415892,99,That'd probably be the Supreme Arenas worth Rubies.  The Treasure Vault has always been Gold based.
560633882202865664,33,The Classic Arena?  Got that too.
560635687045431326,34,Been at this game for over a year.
560635898434289664,5,Nice.
560635955988660228,11,I'm at 470.
560636337099898900,4,Wow.
560636396587581440,53,And meh.  Harbinger isn't too difficult to take down.
560636714478207006,32,A little backup goes a long way.
560636979046383625,77,Divine Warrior makes a great distraction.  And yeah_ wait for face helps too.
