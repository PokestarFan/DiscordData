560600831305449496,53,Wow.  They're BOTH bad? <:sakuRIP:396801184540917766>
560600987824291870,118,I knew Crakgul was bad_ but Caeleth too?  I thought the Divine Shield would be worth something_ but this is just fail.
560601271954964481,39,May as well stick to the Brothers_ huh?
560601456034709528,81,One Mana more and no shield_ but you get two units with basically the same stats.
560601839653879818,87,These "Leader Units" seem to just be a waste of space. <:gooderFail:450744503167352842>
560602468556341262,56,That actually makes sense. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>

560646591959007233,4,Huh.
560646659772776459,54,I guess the only "really" useless card is Dragon Nest.
560646767796944917,15,Gambler's Ball?
560646871614226443,8,...Well.
560647051113660426,38,Never assume something's useless_ huh?
560648520957296651,75,I may actually try and set up those Empyrean and Voidborne decks for teams.
