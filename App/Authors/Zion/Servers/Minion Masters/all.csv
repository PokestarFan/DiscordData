560600831305449496,deckbuilding,53,Wow.  They're BOTH bad? <:sakuRIP:396801184540917766>
560600987824291870,deckbuilding,118,I knew Crakgul was bad_ but Caeleth too?  I thought the Divine Shield would be worth something_ but this is just fail.
560601271954964481,deckbuilding,39,May as well stick to the Brothers_ huh?
560601456034709528,deckbuilding,81,One Mana more and no shield_ but you get two units with basically the same stats.
560601839653879818,deckbuilding,87,These "Leader Units" seem to just be a waste of space. <:gooderFail:450744503167352842>
560602382724235264,minion_masters_general,166,Eh.  It depends for me.  If it's an actually close game then yeah_ long or short_ I consider it legit.  If it's the enemy inducing Healing Cancer though_ not so much.
560602468556341262,deckbuilding,56,That actually makes sense. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560631315049742342,minion_masters_general,74,I wonder if Screaming Scrat can hit the Tower if you use Netherstep on it.
560631378954158081,minion_masters_general,29,<:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560631497112027136,minion_masters_general,91,It's technically on the ground_ and Screaming Scrat hits all ground enemies upon exploding.
560631914697064450,minion_masters_general,44,Yeah_ only one explosion_ then he's useless.
560632049178902552,minion_masters_general,31,Also_ has anyone seen this yet:
560632260198662155,minion_masters_general,59,I waited over a month for it. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560632325210374154,minion_masters_general,44,I hoarded the gold just so I could get this.
560632568706367489,minion_masters_general,22,Still worth it for me.
560632920117739530,minion_masters_general,51,I guess you could call it a personal status symbol.
560633271495688212,minion_masters_general,29,<:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
560633624366415892,minion_masters_general,99,That'd probably be the Supreme Arenas worth Rubies.  The Treasure Vault has always been Gold based.
560633882202865664,minion_masters_general,33,The Classic Arena?  Got that too.
560635687045431326,minion_masters_general,34,Been at this game for over a year.
560635898434289664,minion_masters_general,5,Nice.
560635955988660228,minion_masters_general,11,I'm at 470.
560636337099898900,minion_masters_general,4,Wow.
560636396587581440,minion_masters_general,53,And meh.  Harbinger isn't too difficult to take down.
560636714478207006,minion_masters_general,32,A little backup goes a long way.
560636979046383625,minion_masters_general,77,Divine Warrior makes a great distraction.  And yeah_ wait for face helps too.
560637909523365919,minion_masters_general,27,<:Angry:311053992245460992>
560637933883883540,minion_masters_general,7,CANCER.
