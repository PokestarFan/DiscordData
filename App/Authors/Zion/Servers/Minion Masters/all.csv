560600831305449496,deckbuilding,53,Wow.  They're BOTH bad? <:sakuRIP:396801184540917766>
560600987824291870,deckbuilding,118,I knew Crakgul was bad_ but Caeleth too?  I thought the Divine Shield would be worth something_ but this is just fail.
560601271954964481,deckbuilding,39,May as well stick to the Brothers_ huh?
560601456034709528,deckbuilding,81,One Mana more and no shield_ but you get two units with basically the same stats.
560601839653879818,deckbuilding,87,These "Leader Units" seem to just be a waste of space. <:gooderFail:450744503167352842>
560602382724235264,minion_masters_general,166,Eh.  It depends for me.  If it's an actually close game then yeah_ long or short_ I consider it legit.  If it's the enemy inducing Healing Cancer though_ not so much.
560602468556341262,deckbuilding,56,That actually makes sense. <:sakuLUL:403264452075454470>
