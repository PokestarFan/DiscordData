558757693481943051,198,there are literally four fucking people in my class_ i go to a small liberal arts school so most of the teachers have a pretty good relationship with students_ its a 10 to 1 faculty to student ratio

558758014518034432,182,its a comp course and all of it is writing based and of course i get very minimal feedback when my homework is to read a 20 page essay and then write 500-750 words on it twice a week
