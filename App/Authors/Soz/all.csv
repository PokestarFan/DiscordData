558465980292923408,r/teenagers,general,1,ğŸ¤”

558466406048464926,r/teenagers,general,29,is anyone here not a teenager
558792598416916498,r/teenagers,general,2,oh
558793239482859548,r/teenagers,debates,52,i've just been lurking for a good debate and i'm sad
558793323167481866,r/teenagers,debates,20,oh no it's abortions
558793446824083468,r/teenagers,debates,16,for who exactly?
558793768799830026,r/teenagers,debates,151,it's a super weird topic_ because on one hand maybe some people think abortions should be allowed because the mother should have the freedom to do that
558793803817811969,r/teenagers,debates,42,but on the other hand_ is it really moral?
558793871228796938,r/teenagers,debates,26,well you are taking a life
558794007069589534,r/teenagers,debates,30,i think they should be allowed
558794025490972673,r/teenagers,debates,16,but is it moral?
558794052460609556,r/teenagers,debates,24,i don't exactly think so
558794213395922956,r/teenagers,debates,100,it's like your mom going up to you and saying "i brought you into this world_ so i can take you out"
558794320183033859,r/teenagers,debates,27,well it could've got a life
558794475271618561,r/teenagers,debates,54,i feel like the mother can just set it up for adoption
558794566002671646,r/teenagers,debates,1,^
558794577759174657,r/teenagers,debates,1,^
558794628296605697,r/teenagers,debates,74,that's another problem <@346090620881862658> and i kind of agree with that
558794671212462120,r/teenagers,debates,30,but would you rather be alive?
558794899852623904,r/teenagers,debates,124,i understand that_ i get what you are trying to say: i just don't agree and like someone said this is one of *those* debates
558794931167166474,r/teenagers,debates,41,i think we should move on from this topic
558795248529047552,r/teenagers,debates,58,i have a feeling azul gonna be typing some long paragraphs
558795405572309003,r/teenagers,debates,48,abortion_ but i feel like it's an overdone topic
558795538745786368,r/teenagers,debates,42,ya i agree with azul on that point as well
558795616017448960,r/teenagers,debates,47,but the ending of a life just seems wrong to me
558795968967999508,r/teenagers,debates,4,yeah
558796180763443211,r/teenagers,debates,55,dude that alternate caps and uncaps is annoying as fuck
558796511001968666,r/teenagers,debates,79,do i understand why people abort? yes. Do_ i_ personally_ think it is moral? no
558796826904494085,r/teenagers,debates,16,just /s that boi
558797297505533962,r/teenagers,debates,84,in fact_ the top post on r/teenagers is about a dude being judged for buying condoms
558797362437292052,r/teenagers,debates,41,abortion and stuff <@!439926511517040680>
558797441634140200,r/teenagers,debates,35,i know_ the guy who started it left
558797677169475585,r/teenagers,debates,114,<@!439926511517040680> it's kind of a complicated topic and it feels like people are just screaming their opinions
558797739295768586,r/teenagers,debates,3,yes
558797846271229973,r/teenagers,debates,42,he probably meant that in a differeent way
558797861744017409,r/teenagers,debates,18,or maybe he didn't
558797944350965781,r/teenagers,debates,41,also what's with all these death debates?
558798134646538265,r/teenagers,debates,73,<@!439926511517040680> someone changed the debate to basically euthanasia
558798139470118923,r/teenagers,debates,2,so
558798331527168000,r/teenagers,debates,68,maybe its something they'll regret_ but they have the right to do so
558798380885737476,r/teenagers,debates,15,it's their life
558798423927685120,r/teenagers,debates,4,yeah

558798762349297680,r/teenagers,debates,69,oh i think i heard about that... don't know if it was the same doctor
558800610015838218,r/teenagers,debates,32,cthuluwu: *sweats in shady link*

558801360619831298,r/teenagers,debates,43,can i use this channel to my personal gain?
558801450566942730,r/teenagers,debates,58,cuz i need help to decide between private and pubic school
558801624710119454,r/teenagers,debates,4,lmao
558801861105287178,r/teenagers,debates,132,just so noah can see_ cody says that "you have an irrational hatred towards him " because of something that happened in another chat
558801992026292225,r/teenagers,debates,2,oh
558802073244663829,r/teenagers,debates,53,Hey_ private schoool versus public school; new debate
558802099127713802,r/teenagers,debates,19,which one is better
558802270402248719,r/teenagers,debates,31,but you have to pay for college
558802373426937856,r/teenagers,debates,60,i'm asking this because i need to make a decision about this
558802554138394694,r/teenagers,debates,81,contrary to belief_ the students really looked nice_ and the teachers seemed good
558802618743259136,r/teenagers,debates,35,how about pc versus console gaming?
558802649194168352,r/teenagers,debates,27,or is that not an either or
558802707188547585,r/teenagers,debates,52,<@!439926511517040680> i thought you said new debate
558814281445933088,r/teenagers,debates,27,oof this is still going on?
558814355534249994,r/teenagers,debates,26,true <@325739257622691841>
558815799347773443,r/teenagers,debates,22,why not just ban guns?
558816277435777024,r/teenagers,debates,74,ok fine to some extent i think i might agree with not totally banning guns
558816449700036622,r/teenagers,debates,141,<@!439926511517040680> but_ that law in the constitution was not talking about freaking ak 47s. Why would you need an ak to "defend yourself"
558816677039439878,r/teenagers,debates,25,<@481585290176233482> yup
558816703782453259,r/teenagers,debates,43,that was the context in which they wrote it
558816750045757440,r/teenagers,debates,28,so why would you need an ak?
558817068569591818,r/teenagers,debates,62,<@66164051062816768> my point is AK's are totally over the top
558817139105202179,r/teenagers,debates,46,they are not needed to simply protect yourself
558817163067260929,r/teenagers,debates,17,just use a pistol
558817365693956116,r/teenagers,debates,81,ya_ but handguns do the job_ which is what the 2nd amendment is trying to protect
558817398451470336,r/teenagers,debates,34,but ak 47s are very very dangerous
558817862089834546,r/teenagers,debates,151,correct me if i'm wrong_ but the ak 47 is one of the most dangerous guns of all time. And i'm pretty sure it's been linked to the most school shootings
558818191137046532,r/teenagers,debates,12,yes_ but yes
558818242391703571,r/teenagers,debates,28,i'm a <@!110898859298787328>

558818454220701696,r/teenagers,debates,20,ok_ i get your point
558818511003058186,r/teenagers,debates,47,but i agree with <@202347079979368448> 's point
558818702313914389,r/teenagers,debates,4,lmao
558818825081061387,r/teenagers,debates,39,i think it was like closer to 8 millino
558818832957964311,r/teenagers,debates,7,million
558818864742400010,r/teenagers,debates,13,11? for real?
558819101523574820,r/teenagers,debates,32,actually i think it's 6 mmillion

558819242925883412,r/teenagers,debates,63,i'm not talking about people in general_ i'm talking about jews
558819675694170114,r/teenagers,debates,148,i think it would make sense to tighten U.S. gun control. More background checks and all that. But the thing is_ I don't know how much this will help
558819737577062400,r/teenagers,debates,55,someone who wants to do something bad_ while find a way
558819787590074418,r/teenagers,debates,4,will
558819998810898432,r/teenagers,debates,32,then what's a plausible solution
558820345126060053,r/teenagers,debates,53,sure it is_ it just also pisses off a bunch of people
558820589549125633,r/teenagers,debates,28,we just did like 3 hours ago
558820607433900053,r/teenagers,debates,27,i don't know how that ended
558820782994751488,r/teenagers,debates,107,<@66164051062816768> why is that meaningless? Background checks on social media and past criminal activity?
558820810563911680,r/teenagers,debates,16,won't that help?
558821093607997440,r/teenagers,debates,38,monster's aren't born_ they're created
558821203419332650,r/teenagers,debates,2,ok
558821421233602560,r/teenagers,debates,44,<@66164051062816768> who are you talking to?
558821572563959810,r/teenagers,debates,67,<@347414313495166986> you can ban it on your computer if that helps
558821667892363265,r/teenagers,debates,40,ok_ i haven't done my homework_ i get it
558821924931633164,r/teenagers,debates,3,oof

558822156671123462,r/teenagers,debates,22,not the dumb teen part
558822169715671108,r/teenagers,debates,25,i mean the elastic clause
558822300586344448,r/teenagers,debates,48,their life_ their problem <@!110898859298787328>
558822398355570698,r/teenagers,debates,57,really? freedom of speech is something we shouldn't have?
558822689691664395,r/teenagers,debates,122,sure_ there isn't a full way to stop it. there's always a way. But the least you *can* do is to make them harder to access
558822729487482881,r/teenagers,debates,35,because it's just so easy right now
558822820230987786,r/teenagers,debates,35,<@!278125482732552192> but it helps
558823055174926336,r/teenagers,debates,29,im addicted to lots of things
558823631162048564,r/teenagers,debates,72,ok_ are there any arguments against just making heavy artillery illegal?
558823688124760079,r/teenagers,debates,59,because i feel like that's a decent solution to gun control
558823720517632020,r/teenagers,debates,28,it's not a complete solution
558823728683679758,r/teenagers,debates,18,but it's something
558824099237986314,r/teenagers,debates,108,OK_ look_ i'm probably making myself look like an idiot here_ but artillery isn't needed to protect yourself
558824183748886558,r/teenagers,debates,37,less dangerous weapons can do the job
558824498376212480,r/teenagers,debates,107,i can't find the right word_ but like guns that are fast firing_ very deadly_ things that seem made to kill
558824621043089461,r/teenagers,debates,67,ok since my comment got buried under those links_ i'll say it again
558824626755731457,r/teenagers,debates,107,i can't find the right word_ but like guns that are fast firing_ very deadly_ things that seem made to kill

558824951130619904,r/teenagers,debates,45,since that's what the second amendment is for

558825540786585612,r/teenagers,debates,91,you don't need an automatic gun to protect against a robbery or fighting off the government
558825735951876117,r/teenagers,debates,41,so do it without a freaking automatic gun
