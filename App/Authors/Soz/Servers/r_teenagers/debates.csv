558793239482859548,52,i've just been lurking for a good debate and i'm sad
558793323167481866,20,oh no it's abortions
558793446824083468,16,for who exactly?
558793768799830026,151,it's a super weird topic_ because on one hand maybe some people think abortions should be allowed because the mother should have the freedom to do that
558793803817811969,42,but on the other hand_ is it really moral?
558793871228796938,26,well you are taking a life
558794007069589534,30,i think they should be allowed
558794025490972673,16,but is it moral?
558794052460609556,24,i don't exactly think so
558794213395922956,100,it's like your mom going up to you and saying "i brought you into this world_ so i can take you out"
558794320183033859,27,well it could've got a life
558794475271618561,54,i feel like the mother can just set it up for adoption
558794566002671646,1,^
558794577759174657,1,^
558794628296605697,74,that's another problem <@346090620881862658> and i kind of agree with that
558794671212462120,30,but would you rather be alive?
558794899852623904,124,i understand that_ i get what you are trying to say: i just don't agree and like someone said this is one of *those* debates
558794931167166474,41,i think we should move on from this topic
558795248529047552,58,i have a feeling azul gonna be typing some long paragraphs
558795405572309003,48,abortion_ but i feel like it's an overdone topic
558795538745786368,42,ya i agree with azul on that point as well
558795616017448960,47,but the ending of a life just seems wrong to me
558795968967999508,4,yeah
558796180763443211,55,dude that alternate caps and uncaps is annoying as fuck
558796511001968666,79,do i understand why people abort? yes. Do_ i_ personally_ think it is moral? no
558796826904494085,16,just /s that boi
558797297505533962,84,in fact_ the top post on r/teenagers is about a dude being judged for buying condoms
558797362437292052,41,abortion and stuff <@!439926511517040680>
558797441634140200,35,i know_ the guy who started it left
558797677169475585,114,<@!439926511517040680> it's kind of a complicated topic and it feels like people are just screaming their opinions
558797739295768586,3,yes
558797846271229973,42,he probably meant that in a differeent way
558797861744017409,18,or maybe he didn't
558797944350965781,41,also what's with all these death debates?
558798134646538265,73,<@!439926511517040680> someone changed the debate to basically euthanasia
558798139470118923,2,so
558798331527168000,68,maybe its something they'll regret_ but they have the right to do so
558798380885737476,15,it's their life
558798423927685120,4,yeah
558798476326993930,52,plus what are they gonna do anyways? death sentence?
558798635463344128,10,who's that
558798644497743875,21,<@186569274628767745>
558798762349297680,69,oh i think i heard about that... don't know if it was the same doctor
558800610015838218,32,cthuluwu: *sweats in shady link*
558800833773436968,11,nobody good
558800965701074944,59,wait am i allowed to use this channel to my personal gains?
558801006104936486,9,@ peoplez
558801233851449354,52,no i'm not_ yes you are_ NLNL*but with fancy language*
558801360619831298,43,can i use this channel to my personal gain?
558801450566942730,58,cuz i need help to decide between private and pubic school
558801624710119454,4,lmao
558801861105287178,132,just so noah can see_ cody says that "you have an irrational hatred towards him " because of something that happened in another chat
558801992026292225,2,oh
558802073244663829,53,Hey_ private schoool versus public school; new debate
558802099127713802,19,which one is better
558802270402248719,31,but you have to pay for college
558802373426937856,60,i'm asking this because i need to make a decision about this
558802554138394694,81,contrary to belief_ the students really looked nice_ and the teachers seemed good
558802618743259136,35,how about pc versus console gaming?
558802649194168352,27,or is that not an either or
558802707188547585,52,<@!439926511517040680> i thought you said new debate
558814281445933088,27,oof this is still going on?
558814355534249994,26,true <@325739257622691841>
558815799347773443,22,why not just ban guns?
558816277435777024,74,ok fine to some extent i think i might agree with not totally banning guns
558816449700036622,141,<@!439926511517040680> but_ that law in the constitution was not talking about freaking ak 47s. Why would you need an ak to "defend yourself"
558816677039439878,25,<@481585290176233482> yup
558816703782453259,43,that was the context in which they wrote it
558816750045757440,28,so why would you need an ak?
558817068569591818,62,<@66164051062816768> my point is AK's are totally over the top
558817139105202179,46,they are not needed to simply protect yourself
558817163067260929,17,just use a pistol
558817365693956116,81,ya_ but handguns do the job_ which is what the 2nd amendment is trying to protect
558817398451470336,34,but ak 47s are very very dangerous
558817862089834546,151,correct me if i'm wrong_ but the ak 47 is one of the most dangerous guns of all time. And i'm pretty sure it's been linked to the most school shootings
558818191137046532,12,yes_ but yes
558818242391703571,28,i'm a <@!110898859298787328>
558818349078020127,28,i'm a <@!110898859298787328>
558818454220701696,20,ok_ i get your point
558818511003058186,47,but i agree with <@202347079979368448> 's point
558818702313914389,4,lmao
558818825081061387,39,i think it was like closer to 8 millino
558818832957964311,7,million
558818864742400010,13,11? for real?
558819101523574820,32,actually i think it's 6 mmillion
558819104388153353,118,https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/documenting-numbers-of-victims-of-the-holocaust-and-nazi-persecution
558819126827679747,7,million
558819189725462551,27,link? <@325739257622691841>
558819242925883412,63,i'm not talking about people in general_ i'm talking about jews
558819675694170114,148,i think it would make sense to tighten U.S. gun control. More background checks and all that. But the thing is_ I don't know how much this will help
558819737577062400,55,someone who wants to do something bad_ while find a way
558819787590074418,4,will
558819998810898432,32,then what's a plausible solution
558820345126060053,53,sure it is_ it just also pisses off a bunch of people
558820589549125633,28,we just did like 3 hours ago
558820607433900053,27,i don't know how that ended
558820782994751488,107,<@66164051062816768> why is that meaningless? Background checks on social media and past criminal activity?
558820810563911680,16,won't that help?
558821093607997440,38,monster's aren't born_ they're created
558821203419332650,2,ok
558821421233602560,44,<@66164051062816768> who are you talking to?
558821572563959810,67,<@347414313495166986> you can ban it on your computer if that helps
558821667892363265,40,ok_ i haven't done my homework_ i get it
558821924931633164,3,oof
558821930958979072,7,refuted
558822106641465344,27,<@!278125482732552192> yeah
558822156671123462,22,not the dumb teen part
558822169715671108,25,i mean the elastic clause
558822300586344448,48,their life_ their problem <@!110898859298787328>
558822398355570698,57,really? freedom of speech is something we shouldn't have?
558822689691664395,122,sure_ there isn't a full way to stop it. there's always a way. But the least you *can* do is to make them harder to access
558822729487482881,35,because it's just so easy right now
558822820230987786,35,<@!278125482732552192> but it helps
558823055174926336,29,im addicted to lots of things
558823631162048564,72,ok_ are there any arguments against just making heavy artillery illegal?
558823688124760079,59,because i feel like that's a decent solution to gun control
558823720517632020,28,it's not a complete solution
558823728683679758,18,but it's something
558824099237986314,108,OK_ look_ i'm probably making myself look like an idiot here_ but artillery isn't needed to protect yourself
558824183748886558,37,less dangerous weapons can do the job
558824498376212480,107,i can't find the right word_ but like guns that are fast firing_ very deadly_ things that seem made to kill
558824621043089461,67,ok since my comment got buried under those links_ i'll say it again
558824626755731457,107,i can't find the right word_ but like guns that are fast firing_ very deadly_ things that seem made to kill
558824817592238080,20,automatic guns_ yeah
558824913696325642,3,yes
558824928548487188,23,for protecting yourself
558824951130619904,45,since that's what the second amendment is for
558825003546705940,2,^&
558825058269921290,40,<@166496803733110784> i agree with alexx
558825088292487206,1,^
558825176947490818,47,see there something that's called going too far
558825205305311246,1,^
558825216860618782,7,damn it
558825255897137189,9,it's cool
558825343545245718,49,because it's more than needed to protect yourself
558825387971313691,29,that's what i'm trying to say
558825540786585612,91,you don't need an automatic gun to protect against a robbery or fighting off the government
558825735951876117,41,so do it without a freaking automatic gun
558825793242005514,28,ok this is going nowhere man
558825883050311690,34,you are going to get rekt by chaos
558825940705345545,24,can i get an f for alexx

558826526251155458,33,i feel like this is going nowhere
558826539169349634,18,chaos is too smart
558826667108204595,12,sure you can
558826689795457039,15,he/she just did
558826719625084958,4,cool
558826958956527616,64,ok but i still don't understand why you can't ban automatic guns
558827092863746048,50,wait are they banned? @ everyone here in this chat
558827118784544779,21,automatic guns i mean
558827311303098378,89,ok_ then let me ask this_ what plausible reason would anyone have to own an automatic gun
558827483479146516,28,bye ðŸ˜Š <@!110898859298787328>
558827613720936468,50,nobody has still answered the automatic gun thing?
558827664031612950,51,what reason do you have for owning an automatic gun
558827846940884992,27,ok_ i'm uneducated_ explain
