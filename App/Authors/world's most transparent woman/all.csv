558115897953353728,r/teenagers,debates,180,"assault weapons" kill a negligible amount of people a year compared to handguns_ even Destiny who can be  pretty small-brained at times will agree with most right wingers about it
558116014949400586,r/teenagers,debates,64,it's absurd to focus on banning or modifying m4 platform weapons
558116188010446849,r/teenagers,debates,150,I mean sure they're "scary" but it doesn't matter whether something it matters or not_ the people matter_ and the problem really isn't assault weapons
558116215252320257,r/teenagers,debates,53,they're the absurd amount of handguns floating around
558116314682621962,r/teenagers,debates,74,the amount of homicides per year committed with m4-style weapons is like 0
558116622771159040,r/teenagers,debates,127,if lawmakers quit wasting time on stupid useless m4 restrictions they might be able to actually do something about the problem?
558116819865567242,r/teenagers,debates,195,I guess it's a fair thing that must be brought up that right wing lobbyists do have a lot of control over many aspects of gun control_ so they're only able to do the stuff they're currently doing
558116853134786592,r/teenagers,debates,38,point remains that it's pretty useless
558116996013752320,r/teenagers,debates,89,a lot of crimes are committed with guns that are purchased legally but obtained illegally
558117137940742154,r/teenagers,debates,131,so it's possible to regulate legally purchased guns_ reducing the amount of guns that are illegally transferred and used for crimes
558117217246642187,r/teenagers,debates,35,yes that too I agree wholeheartedly
558117373073162242,r/teenagers,debates,210,it's not that there are more or less guns now than in the 60s and 90s but a lot of other factors have changed and we should look at those rather than just the guns which have always been a part of american life
558117683170639902,r/teenagers,debates,74,in new zealand that might work but the US is a totally different situation
558117735331135499,r/teenagers,debates,61,the homicide rate in new zealand is minute compared to the US
558117823256199178,r/teenagers,debates,55,in that case lobbying would just be called stakeholders
558117861646925825,r/teenagers,debates,28,lobbying in the US is fucked
558118073492832267,r/teenagers,debates,222,people do focus on the mass shooters a lot which do tend to use AR-platform guns but mass shootings really aren't the problem in the US_ the bigger problem is the tens of thousands of homicides committed using smaller arms
