558765134676361226,r/teenagers,debates,92,I mean he's literally planning to spend our budget on a wall which will do virtually nothing
558765348854169610,r/teenagers,debates,39,I mean let's think about this logically
558765369251332096,r/teenagers,debates,18,If you build a wal

558765633089568781,r/teenagers,debates,122,However_ when you get in the usa_ it will be difficult to do anything_ especially with trumps hatred of illegal immigrants
558765814904258575,r/teenagers,debates,137,I personally think it would be best if he let them come in_ especially for asylum_ considering countries like china and North Korea exist
558765887159664651,r/teenagers,debates,49,Though the effect on the economy could be drastic
558766023881392128,r/teenagers,debates,19,Or what we could do
558766142773002266,r/teenagers,debates,96,Is let anyone come in for any reason on the caviat that they join the military for a year or two
558766214537543703,r/teenagers,debates,63,It gets our body force up_ and helps with people seeking asylum

558766574476066826,r/teenagers,debates,47,I mean I don't want the us to become russia 2.0
558766653756670002,r/teenagers,debates,80,Because rn russia is barely staying up considering what putin is doing over ther

558767698637750279,r/teenagers,debates,94,That is definitely true_ though how they do that is ruining how people interact with eachother

558768160157859850,r/teenagers,debates,45,I mean most of the middle east is tbh aandrew
