558785611230609428,programming,30,what program were you writing?
558825929388982302,general-discussions,52,In general you dont want to use any sort of import *
558826036184481802,general-discussions,59,it makes it harder to track where stuff actually comes from
558826329546686485,general-discussions,96,it would be nicer if you could say stuff like `import java.util.{ArrayList_ List_ Map_ HashMap}`
558826363147124746,general-discussions,15,but cest la vie
558832650949754900,programming,63,conceptually an array is not a good fit for continual appending
558832774342246411,programming,118,If you want to do an operation like that you would be best off writing or finding your own "ArrayList" kind of wrapper
558833123811524638,programming,58,I think you don't quite understand what an array in c _is_
558833202815565825,programming,34,it is a fixed size block of memory
558833229780484148,programming,39,that you have a pointer to the start of
558833301725511700,programming,55,it is up to you to keep track of the size of that array
558833325943554078,programming,25,usually in a seperate int
558833389654769664,programming,69,because you only have the pointer to the start of the block of memory
558833485142556674,programming,95,nothing about that pointer can tell you how much memory ahead of that you are allowed to access
558833647302606849,programming,160,so if you keep the size of the array and the pointer to the start of the array held somewhere then the "index of the last item" is something you implicitly know
558834656754008073,programming,53,and I might be wrong when I say to store it in an int
558834705592483842,programming,40,it might be a `usize` or some other type
558834734483111948,programming,31,I am not super well versed in C
558834781337550857,programming,45,and I don't have classes that make me write C
558834845690757154,programming,28,so I have no desire to learn
558834869896085527,programming,14,rust 2019 baby
558836141651001375,programming,54,The type you are looking for in rust is probably `Vec`
558836246571384832,programming,72,can you share your problem and what you were thinking of for a solution?
558836968654503943,programming,64,I can maybe whip up a quick A/B of what it would be in C vs rust
558837496327307287,programming,65,Actually I am kinda bored so i could use the mindless distraction
558838506462380072,programming,46,is this for a class or for a personal project?
558838627145089044,programming,41,cool_ means you can use whatever you want
558838656161546302,programming,8,what db?
558838685718675488,programming,6,gotcha
558839798748676097,programming,27,any more details than that?
558839938129461258,programming,43,do you have a schema you were messing with?
558839981297106959,programming,29,like_ the SQL you were using?
558840113631592458,programming,64,well if you are using sqlite you started off by creating a table
558840131813900289,programming,26,and then you inserted data
558840155767701514,programming,28,and now you want to query it
558840324198236171,programming,79,I want to stick to what you were doing so I don't have to think about sql today
558840733889724437,programming,10,ahh gotcha
558840765682548756,programming,29,whats the schema for entries?
558841081064587275,programming,67,thats good_ but i meant specifically the sql for creating the table
558841133334003723,programming,23,eh whatever I can do it
558841223897546752,programming,79,remember kids: If you try too hard to be lazy_ you are actually doing more work

558847811672735797,programming,39,and that is the only library i am using
558849214507909130,programming,10,thats fair
558849338047201291,programming,88,C is definitely a simpler language in terms of number of concepts you need to understand
558850073497436180,programming,0,
558850121387737100,programming,97,`For the third year in a row_ Rust is the most loved programming language among our respondents_`
558850856007630848,programming,98,Not a quality assessment_ but I want to frontload good press because the language is hard to learn

558850995887669259,programming,51,but once you learn it people tend to really like it
558851159087906828,programming,33,in the future because it is march
558852353717960714,programming,48,Hey mods_ just thinking out loud without context
558852526523285506,programming,92,is there a way to give people badges for what languages and tools they are comfortable with?
558852648355233830,programming,103,It would save me quite a bit of time asking people to get context on what is limiting their perspective
558853309641785358,programming,104,<@153146360705712128> What languages are you comfortable with and can use. You choose where that line is
558853360132947979,programming,45,And have you done a larger project in python?
558855234063958047,programming,90,I think that has far less to do with the language itself and more to do with the ecosystem
558859353709477898,general-discussions,47,I don't see why sorting by length is a priority
558859420625403905,general-discussions,71,though I am sure you can configure the autoformatter somehow to do that
558867670787817473,general-discussions,99,For me_ when i name a collection of things it usually ends up that using plural describes it better
558867728166027287,general-discussions,41,but it all depends on what you are naming
558867793882120212,general-discussions,53,i wouldnt make a collection of cats and call it `cat`
558867812219617283,general-discussions,20,thats just confusing
558867981711704064,general-discussions,47,but if you are keeping some messages in a queue
558868150750543893,general-discussions,131,`messageQueue` works as a name since having the word queue implies both the direction data flows and the idea of possible plurality
559041057438957578,general-discussions,101,`For example wrong path gone in prod_ thing run QA but Not on prod_ skipping some basic sanity check`
559042809202606100,general-discussions,48,and you should do as little "faking" as possible
559043704959139853,general-discussions,114,and there should be at least a warning on the PR if it drops at all so it can be discussed with your code reviewer
559044572026503169,general-discussions,35,but that should all be a good start
559045704014757911,general-discussions,115,well_ it sounds like you need to bite the bullet on that and start putting your head in the weeds and writing tests
559046103144726528,general-discussions,33,yeah but its high priority to you
559046253510393884,general-discussions,94,if you don't pay off tech debt as you go_ screw the company_ _*your(_ life is going to be hell
559049684367179777,general-discussions,41,(if you feel comfortable - what company?)
559050134332112916,general-discussions,61,So here is where whatever soft skills you have come into play
559050271364481024,general-discussions,88,you need to convince a single teammate that it is worth the effort to move to automation
559050280457469957,general-discussions,8,just one
559050315731697666,general-discussions,13,thats a start
559050470061244437,general-discussions,122,your goal is to eventually have everyone on the devlopment team believe that moving to automation is the right thing to do
559050540269436939,general-discussions,77,and with 10 engineers someone will figure out a sensible roadmap to get there
559050696448671747,general-discussions,157,then the most senior person is going to have to lay it out to management that if you keep going like you are_ you are going to dig yourselves deeper in a pit
559050725804736526,general-discussions,42,and you will eventually end up like oracle
559051300277321740,general-discussions,29,what is your experience like?
559051322574241794,general-discussions,73,Asking just in case leaving that company might end up being the best call
559051351418732544,general-discussions,7,4 what?
559051438773501982,general-discussions,21,...are you kidding me
559051458398388234,general-discussions,11,in industry
559051473971970060,general-discussions,21,at that same company?
559051753228861441,general-discussions,20,where are you based?
559051804621537290,general-discussions,35,and why did you leave the other two
559051983047360525,general-discussions,26,what's your pay in rupees?
559052415056347155,general-discussions,88,(pretend I am just translating on google and don't know what the abbreviation lpa means)
559052863637159946,general-discussions,83,I know cost per living is lower there but that is super bad for a software engineer
559053251430055986,general-discussions,58,You could make alot more money working for other companies
559053302873063444,general-discussions,29,even just remote for a US one
559053437812342794,general-discussions,39,Thats my current yearly wage translated
559053619261866004,general-discussions,41,well anyways you know what you need to do
559053634533326873,general-discussions,19,convince management
559053880957206537,general-discussions,54,(and I will point out that i am a "fresher" right now)
560285502305992735,general-discussions,36,<@153146360705712128>  one at a time
560285513664167957,general-discussions,9,seriously
560285542084771850,general-discussions,23,i want to hear #3 first
560285876681310233,general-discussions,101,they has spent alot of time on this project and we want to be constructive_ not drown them in critism
560608522220339220,programming,47,I think large project might be the wrong phrase
560608555485495298,programming,46,"projects that have more than one source file"
560608849367793675,programming,104,just take my word for it_ as someone who pushed his projects to github when they were 15-16_ it pays off
560608896725680139,programming,21,itll just take awhile
560954752565903404,programming,37,its fascinating the power of defaults
560954801463099393,programming,47,scala case classes have the worst toString ever
560954840210210843,programming,25,but people never touch it

561010020565909505,programming,52,kinda a shitty representation when you want to debug
