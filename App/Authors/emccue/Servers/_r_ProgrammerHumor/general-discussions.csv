558825929388982302,52,In general you dont want to use any sort of import *
558826036184481802,59,it makes it harder to track where stuff actually comes from
558826329546686485,96,it would be nicer if you could say stuff like `import java.util.{ArrayList_ List_ Map_ HashMap}`
558826363147124746,15,but cest la vie
558859353709477898,47,I don't see why sorting by length is a priority
558859420625403905,71,though I am sure you can configure the autoformatter somehow to do that
558867670787817473,99,For me_ when i name a collection of things it usually ends up that using plural describes it better
558867728166027287,41,but it all depends on what you are naming
558867793882120212,53,i wouldnt make a collection of cats and call it `cat`
558867812219617283,20,thats just confusing
558867981711704064,47,but if you are keeping some messages in a queue
558868150750543893,131,`messageQueue` works as a name since having the word queue implies both the direction data flows and the idea of possible plurality
559041057438957578,101,`For example wrong path gone in prod_ thing run QA but Not on prod_ skipping some basic sanity check`
559042809202606100,48,and you should do as little "faking" as possible
559043704959139853,114,and there should be at least a warning on the PR if it drops at all so it can be discussed with your code reviewer
