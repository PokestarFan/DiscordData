558825929388982302,52,In general you dont want to use any sort of import *
558826036184481802,59,it makes it harder to track where stuff actually comes from
558826329546686485,96,it would be nicer if you could say stuff like `import java.util.{ArrayList_ List_ Map_ HashMap}`
558826363147124746,15,but cest la vie
558859353709477898,47,I don't see why sorting by length is a priority
558859420625403905,71,though I am sure you can configure the autoformatter somehow to do that
558867670787817473,99,For me_ when i name a collection of things it usually ends up that using plural describes it better
558867728166027287,41,but it all depends on what you are naming
558867793882120212,53,i wouldnt make a collection of cats and call it `cat`
558867812219617283,20,thats just confusing
558867981711704064,47,but if you are keeping some messages in a queue
558868150750543893,131,`messageQueue` works as a name since having the word queue implies both the direction data flows and the idea of possible plurality
559041057438957578,101,`For example wrong path gone in prod_ thing run QA but Not on prod_ skipping some basic sanity check`
559042809202606100,48,and you should do as little "faking" as possible
559043704959139853,114,and there should be at least a warning on the PR if it drops at all so it can be discussed with your code reviewer
559044572026503169,35,but that should all be a good start
559045704014757911,115,well_ it sounds like you need to bite the bullet on that and start putting your head in the weeds and writing tests
559046103144726528,33,yeah but its high priority to you
559046253510393884,94,if you don't pay off tech debt as you go_ screw the company_ _*your(_ life is going to be hell
559049684367179777,41,(if you feel comfortable - what company?)
559050134332112916,61,So here is where whatever soft skills you have come into play
559050271364481024,88,you need to convince a single teammate that it is worth the effort to move to automation
559050280457469957,8,just one
559050315731697666,13,thats a start
559050470061244437,122,your goal is to eventually have everyone on the devlopment team believe that moving to automation is the right thing to do
559050540269436939,77,and with 10 engineers someone will figure out a sensible roadmap to get there
559050696448671747,157,then the most senior person is going to have to lay it out to management that if you keep going like you are_ you are going to dig yourselves deeper in a pit
559050725804736526,42,and you will eventually end up like oracle
559051300277321740,29,what is your experience like?
559051322574241794,73,Asking just in case leaving that company might end up being the best call
559051351418732544,7,4 what?
559051438773501982,21,...are you kidding me
559051458398388234,11,in industry
559051473971970060,21,at that same company?
559051753228861441,20,where are you based?
559051804621537290,35,and why did you leave the other two
559051983047360525,26,what's your pay in rupees?
559052415056347155,88,(pretend I am just translating on google and don't know what the abbreviation lpa means)
559052863637159946,83,I know cost per living is lower there but that is super bad for a software engineer
559053251430055986,58,You could make alot more money working for other companies
559053302873063444,29,even just remote for a US one
559053437812342794,39,Thats my current yearly wage translated
559053619261866004,41,well anyways you know what you need to do
559053634533326873,19,convince management
559053880957206537,54,(and I will point out that i am a "fresher" right now)
560285502305992735,36,<@153146360705712128>  one at a time
560285513664167957,9,seriously
560285542084771850,23,i want to hear #3 first
560285876681310233,101,they has spent alot of time on this project and we want to be constructive_ not drown them in critism
