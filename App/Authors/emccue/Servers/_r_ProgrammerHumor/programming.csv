558785611230609428,30,what program were you writing?
558832650949754900,63,conceptually an array is not a good fit for continual appending
558832774342246411,118,If you want to do an operation like that you would be best off writing or finding your own "ArrayList" kind of wrapper
558833123811524638,58,I think you don't quite understand what an array in c _is_
558833202815565825,34,it is a fixed size block of memory
558833229780484148,39,that you have a pointer to the start of
558833301725511700,55,it is up to you to keep track of the size of that array
558833325943554078,25,usually in a seperate int
558833389654769664,69,because you only have the pointer to the start of the block of memory
558833485142556674,95,nothing about that pointer can tell you how much memory ahead of that you are allowed to access
558833647302606849,160,so if you keep the size of the array and the pointer to the start of the array held somewhere then the "index of the last item" is something you implicitly know
558834656754008073,53,and I might be wrong when I say to store it in an int
558834705592483842,40,it might be a `usize` or some other type
558834734483111948,31,I am not super well versed in C
558834781337550857,45,and I don't have classes that make me write C
558834845690757154,28,so I have no desire to learn
558834869896085527,14,rust 2019 baby
558836141651001375,54,The type you are looking for in rust is probably `Vec`
558836246571384832,72,can you share your problem and what you were thinking of for a solution?
558836968654503943,64,I can maybe whip up a quick A/B of what it would be in C vs rust
558837496327307287,65,Actually I am kinda bored so i could use the mindless distraction
558838506462380072,46,is this for a class or for a personal project?
558838627145089044,41,cool_ means you can use whatever you want
558838656161546302,8,what db?
558838685718675488,6,gotcha
558839798748676097,27,any more details than that?
558839938129461258,43,do you have a schema you were messing with?
558839981297106959,29,like_ the SQL you were using?
558840113631592458,64,well if you are using sqlite you started off by creating a table
558840131813900289,26,and then you inserted data
558840155767701514,28,and now you want to query it
558840324198236171,79,I want to stick to what you were doing so I don't have to think about sql today
558840733889724437,10,ahh gotcha
558840765682548756,29,whats the schema for entries?
558841081064587275,67,thats good_ but i meant specifically the sql for creating the table
558841133334003723,23,eh whatever I can do it
558841223897546752,79,remember kids: If you try too hard to be lazy_ you are actually doing more work

558847811672735797,39,and that is the only library i am using
558849214507909130,10,thats fair
558849338047201291,88,C is definitely a simpler language in terms of number of concepts you need to understand
558850073497436180,0,
558850121387737100,97,`For the third year in a row_ Rust is the most loved programming language among our respondents_`
558850856007630848,98,Not a quality assessment_ but I want to frontload good press because the language is hard to learn

558850995887669259,51,but once you learn it people tend to really like it
558851159087906828,33,in the future because it is march
558852353717960714,48,Hey mods_ just thinking out loud without context
558852526523285506,92,is there a way to give people badges for what languages and tools they are comfortable with?
558852648355233830,103,It would save me quite a bit of time asking people to get context on what is limiting their perspective
558853309641785358,104,<@153146360705712128> What languages are you comfortable with and can use. You choose where that line is
558853360132947979,45,And have you done a larger project in python?
558855234063958047,90,I think that has far less to do with the language itself and more to do with the ecosystem
560608522220339220,47,I think large project might be the wrong phrase
560608555485495298,46,"projects that have more than one source file"
560608849367793675,104,just take my word for it_ as someone who pushed his projects to github when they were 15-16_ it pays off
560608896725680139,21,itll just take awhile
560954752565903404,37,its fascinating the power of defaults
560954801463099393,47,scala case classes have the worst toString ever
560954840210210843,25,but people never touch it
