558761141531181086,technical-bedrock,367,Pretty much_ when changing the shape_ you'll need a new texture as well.NLYet I have no experience on that so I was only pointing it out for others to help …NLDo note we here do not like to hold people's hand arcross the street as well as on the sidewalk (or in other words_ we won't do your work for you if you refuse to learn and attempt to do stuff yourself as well)
