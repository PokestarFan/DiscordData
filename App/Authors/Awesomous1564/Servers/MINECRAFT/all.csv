558825718293987341,technical-bedrock,161,Hey guys! Is there any way to go back to the old Minecraft textures on the Nintendo Switch edition? I prefer the old ones and it seems there's no way to go back.
558827317590491138,technical-bedrock,113,That's kinda dumb. I think there should just be a toggle switch under video or resource packs to use old textures
558827403871518720,technical-bedrock,37,Oh all newer consoles work on bedrock
558828210444304423,technical-bedrock,78,Off-topic but why the HECK can't we pause in single player in bedrock edition?
558828928450560015,technical-bedrock,194,There's a thread in the official feedback column about pausing and they said they'd fix it 6 months ago but it hasn't happened yet. Seems to me like a no-brainer to put pausing in single player.
558829262136934400,technical-bedrock,66,Hmm... <@339883917530365953> are you trying to play LAN or online?
558829461399666689,technical-bedrock,109,If it's online you'll need to make sure you've both got a subscription to the Nintendo Switch Online service.
558829509495881729,technical-bedrock,23,And a Microsoft account
558829707986993191,technical-bedrock,48,Are you both friends on the switch friend thing?
558829880503042094,technical-bedrock,27,Hmm well then I'm not sure.
558829897007759390,technical-bedrock,5,Sorry
558830120283013121,technical-bedrock,65,Anyone else know the answer to <@339883917530365953> 's question?
558830165270986763,technical-bedrock,2,Oh
558830261756887042,technical-bedrock,29,Oops I'm kind of a slow typer
