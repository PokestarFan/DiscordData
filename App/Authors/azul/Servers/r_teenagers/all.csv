558788843461935117,debates,11,No it isn't
558789029022138379,debates,95,The word trap comes from trans women "tricking" or "trapping" straight men with their birth sex
558789068406915148,debates,20,Which is transphobic
558789191534772264,debates,45,The word comes from its use with trans people

558793982415470592,debates,82,With the birth of an unwanted baby_ the mother's life will be economically fucked.
558794170966212608,debates,32,Why do you think it's not moral>
558794277308727298,debates,68,The life you're ending has no understanding of life outside the womb
558794300016558080,debates,48,they don't know they had the chance for anything
558794337148993547,debates,13,it could have
558794357981970474,debates,36,but what does that mean for the baby
558794421567488020,debates,67,in the context of the baby there's nothing else outside of the womb
558794538043572225,debates,61,You're already giving a worse start off in life by doing that
558794689453621251,debates,5,jesus
558794706520113171,debates,36,how many times do I have to say this
558794747704246313,debates,67,in the context of the baby_ they don't know a life outside the womb
558794774635741185,debates,39,they don't know they could be something
558794824182923265,debates,79,ending someone's chance at something they don't know exists isn't morally wrong
558796311810408461,debates,678,The problem with abortion is that people always go straight to "you're murdering babies with potential!!!" However_ the case is that with the birth of an unwanted baby you're hurting that babies potential in life by giving it a disadvantage at day one_ either by allowing it to be adopted or by letting it live with the parents who didn't want it_ and are most likely in poverty (one of the largest indicators for poverty is having a kid out of wedlock under 25). Not only this_ but you're hurting the mother's economic protentional_ the birth of a baby is a huge fucking task. Imagine trying to get through college while being pregnant_ and then while taking care of your baby.
558796722495553597,debates,50,Condoms should be available in all men's restrooms

558797189959254026,debates,6,or don
558797865967681539,debates,73,there should be something that makes sure it isn't just a temporary thing
558797907633897523,debates,95,imagine having something terrible happen to you one day and you literally want to kill yourself
558797932112117771,debates,27,it takes time to get better
558797988487757846,debates,18,of course they can
558798519662542848,debates,76,i thought the debate was more around someone signing themselves to be killed
558798533919244288,debates,32,not the right to kill themselves
558798538432053259,debates,4,lmao
558800019327811607,debates,131,> not allowing people to kill themselves when they are facing problems by instead trying to treat them NL> Cthuluwu says this is bad
