560600462445772800,58,Beta storm is fine_ but its very toigh in plankerton biome
560600721817468929,39,I got blakebeard_ now to get the pistol
560601043046498305,45,To be fair_ imo industrial is the best for it
560601248844480512,64,I dont want to level blakebeard higher tho_ cause 4star is skele
560601375642222593,54,Shrooms are te hardest to find in plankerton biome tho
560601436270886913,74,Especially since it only counts the orange shrooms and not the other types
560601480491434036,16,Most of the time
560601776076619836,77,Im basing this off the multiple defeats when doing the beta in autumn suburbs
560620855101620241,34,(Yes you get naked lizard man ass)
560620909988282389,1,^
560620974777827343,4,Riot
560621095284244491,55,No more pants or i wont fight_ stop denying me my right
560621161268903937,12,#NoPantsDire
560622090131341334,37,Gotta be more specific a lot happened
560623088597729301,13,Next question
560623164804300821,44,WHY DOES HYBRID HAVE A VOICE AND DIRE DOESNT
560623382966697984,41,I like the effect on the dragon slash tho
560624800234733569,28,Its not those kind of caches
560624878898642950,50,Its just a standard 'go to map_ pick up quest obj'
560624991050137630,27,Trash cans are common sense
560625039347810325,39,The caches could have been named better
560628798585045002,74,<@331127760619700235> dont do it in autumn suburbs zone_ they hardly spawn
560629668768776202,128,*is still annoyed that hybrid has voice acting and doesnt have to wear pants but dire has to wear pants and has no voice acting*
560631464652177409,14,Gg ez get rekt
560631761227350016,41,Hybrid has only been out for an hour_ lol
560631809600389140,26,But yeah_ his perk is nice
560631914361520163,58,Plus a pretty good ability set; dragon slash_ stars_ kunai
560632194880765973,51,Trap is a stronger wall darts but double the reload
560632283384774656,31,Also doesnt shoot through ramps
560632456890286090,28,But does pierce dome shields
560633400692834319,1,?
560633781376253952,1,^
560633817820299285,33,He should know_ he is the spambot
560642188254642176,57,<@502535756359794688> item shop is always wedneday night?
560643106395914252,1,^
560643264492077056,1,^
560643644630237200,70,<@203176871553269761> he doesnt wear pants_ thats all you need to know
560643786871406612,30,Not even <@413149033255927811>
560643996502851604,112,His support perk only increases affliction dmg_ you only get the affliction on dragon slash when he is commander
560644517058052096,98,<@343465191456899072> it seems nice_ its up to you. It looks like a good perk for defender weapons
560644702601347073,42,Im not a fan of how they force a playstyle
560645042579177472,26,We're testing him out_ yes
560645216835469352,31,It inceases affliction duration
560645319092731904,66,So if you had a weapon that causes affliction_ it will last longer
560645404694282253,65,Im loading a mission right now to see if it boosts gas traps_ lol
560645867460231192,51,It does not make gas trap affliction last longer :/
560646111161876492,67,But for commander perk_ it adds fire affliction to his dragon slash
560646283803754502,72,So after you slash through_ they'll take additional ticks of fire damage
560646581477441563,1,?
560646737602281475,38,Go into a map_ collect a thing_ repeat
560646825032417303,28,Like every other fetch quest
560646905185435678,7,Git gud
560646930611568641,19,Been working for me
560647334556336139,56,I mean_ you dont even get the special rosie until 2 star
560647408443457536,27,And yeah_ looks like a x2.5
560647515406467115,23,With two headshot perks
560647703265148928,56,^ i've been complaining about that <@413149033255927811>
560647836438495272,63,The beta storm is fine_ its just autumn biome that sucks for it
560647974699532320,77,<@413149033255927811> he has no pants and a voice_ dire has pants an no voice
560648229276876800,92,For jack's revenge_ keep in mind that it is also a one-shot magazine with a base 3sec reload
560649085246504978,38,Its a cannonball version of wall darts
560650071209803776,63,We have a furry and a scalie_ a fish isnt that far of a stretch
560650826134061056,57,The truth killed the chat <:kylethink:504286093563265064>
560651417405358102,148,Lets be honest tho_ we'll get the banana constructor with Peel the Base before we get fishstick_ it would be an impact version of electrified floors
560651577254215691,11,No you cant
560651689288531979,75,I finished the entire questline_ im looking at the spring map and its blank
560652025340231690,84,<@233471870572167168> also you bring up lynx but you dont mention bunny penny_ shame
560652160065339404,15,And catstructor
560652352714178600,41,No one talks about the gimp rabbit raider
560652755459375104,32,<@405531123028983808> game logic
560653506525003796,28,Its not thicc_ its muscle :P
560653527836262400,5,Kappa
560653827704094740,72,Whats wierd_ hybrid doesnt change colors after 3stars like dire and lynx
560976046451851264,26,Only a +50% hs dmg at base
560976419489054741,100,<@255493088510738433> its up to you_ jack's revenge only has 1 shot magazine_ but good for headshots
560976521716826124,29,X2.5 base headshot multiplier
560976580713644044,24,1 shot_ 3sec base reload
560976783617294336,3,Yep
560976886801629185,54,But you only get 25 cannon balls_ with a 3min cooldown
560976921924730890,25,Pick your shots carefully
560977055097946112,21,For mostly everything
560977133787152396,54,Thats why i use cooldown reduction perks on everything
560977178423066654,23,10-15 sec is reasonable
560977547899174922,49,I should reset my machinist since she useless now
560978932959150100,54,<@189856293509398529> why you betray wolfboi like this
560979149330841648,78,<@302921272482856972> its a normal fetch mission_ go into maps and find things
560979494425329684,38,Its not that_ its a normal fetch quest
560979580379201536,80,Literally go into normal missions_ run around and look for the exclamation point
560979701460369409,31,Took me 3 missions to get all 5
560980352026411008,58,The problem with team perks_ it doesnt count the commander
