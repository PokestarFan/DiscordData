560600462445772800,58,Beta storm is fine_ but its very toigh in plankerton biome
560600721817468929,39,I got blakebeard_ now to get the pistol
560601043046498305,45,To be fair_ imo industrial is the best for it
560601248844480512,64,I dont want to level blakebeard higher tho_ cause 4star is skele
560601375642222593,54,Shrooms are te hardest to find in plankerton biome tho
560601436270886913,74,Especially since it only counts the orange shrooms and not the other types
560601480491434036,16,Most of the time
560601776076619836,77,Im basing this off the multiple defeats when doing the beta in autumn suburbs
560620855101620241,34,(Yes you get naked lizard man ass)

560622090131341334,37,Gotta be more specific a lot happened
560623088597729301,13,Next question
560623164804300821,44,WHY DOES HYBRID HAVE A VOICE AND DIRE DOESNT
560623382966697984,41,I like the effect on the dragon slash tho
560624800234733569,28,Its not those kind of caches
560624878898642950,50,Its just a standard 'go to map_ pick up quest obj'
560624991050137630,27,Trash cans are common sense
560625039347810325,39,The caches could have been named better
560628798585045002,74,<@331127760619700235> dont do it in autumn suburbs zone_ they hardly spawn
560629668768776202,128,*is still annoyed that hybrid has voice acting and doesnt have to wear pants but dire has to wear pants and has no voice acting*
560631464652177409,14,Gg ez get rekt
560631761227350016,41,Hybrid has only been out for an hour_ lol
560631809600389140,26,But yeah_ his perk is nice
560631914361520163,58,Plus a pretty good ability set; dragon slash_ stars_ kunai
560632194880765973,51,Trap is a stronger wall darts but double the reload
560632283384774656,31,Also doesnt shoot through ramps
560632456890286090,28,But does pierce dome shields
560633400692834319,1,?
560633781376253952,1,^
560633817820299285,33,He should know_ he is the spambot
560642188254642176,57,<@502535756359794688> item shop is always wedneday night?
560643106395914252,1,^
560643264492077056,1,^
560643644630237200,70,<@203176871553269761> he doesnt wear pants_ thats all you need to know
560643786871406612,30,Not even <@413149033255927811>
560643996502851604,112,His support perk only increases affliction dmg_ you only get the affliction on dragon slash when he is commander
560644517058052096,98,<@343465191456899072> it seems nice_ its up to you. It looks like a good perk for defender weapons
560644702601347073,42,Im not a fan of how they force a playstyle
560645042579177472,26,We're testing him out_ yes
560645216835469352,31,It inceases affliction duration
560645319092731904,66,So if you had a weapon that causes affliction_ it will last longer
560645404694282253,65,Im loading a mission right now to see if it boosts gas traps_ lol
