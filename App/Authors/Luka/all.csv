559039552208109578,r/teenagers,debates,2,So
559039567962046476,r/teenagers,debates,19,Ill put this simply
559039941301239808,r/teenagers,debates,488,It is in the best interest of a foreigner to learn the local language_ as it will make their lives easier: they would be able to explain to a local cashier that he wants 2 kilograms of corn flower and not 2 cucumbers for example. The process is for their ultimate good. But if they don't learn it_ that is their own problem. They have the prerogative to do as they wish-try to assimilate *better*_ the key word here is better. You can still assimilate without learning the local language.
559039982661271573,r/teenagers,debates,29,Its their liberty to learn it
559039996385034240,r/teenagers,debates,9,Or not to
559040035584999434,r/teenagers,debates,42,and it will either make their lives harded
559040049090527253,r/teenagers,debates,9,or easier
559040055184850945,r/teenagers,debates,6,period
