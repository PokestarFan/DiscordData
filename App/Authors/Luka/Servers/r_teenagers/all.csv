558992424999976961,debates,177,this is such an old news (im talking 2014s iirc) that ill have to dig. plus it wasnt even in English_ Ill try to. and the statement was "going against Christian xenophobia" iirc
558992560576528384,debates,112,And I agree with them_ Im neither a Christian nor straight_ But their action will have unfavourable consequences
558992714335649794,debates,57,I dont want to say anything false so Ill just look for it
559008311945592842,debates,7,🦀 🦀 🦀 🦀
559011454976655372,debates,67,Does anyone with a mildly functioning brain actually fall for that?

559038271225724951,debates,3,no?
559038318113980436,debates,56,If they wanted to_ they would have learnt english by now

559038634871750676,debates,12,ideally_ yes
559038656447381514,debates,28,But if they dont_ their loss
559038673858068510,debates,23,Thats the whole verdict
559038833501405215,debates,162,Stop caring about others successes and losses and focus on your own_ I think Jose from Belize can figure out whats best for him without the governments directives
559038910911741962,debates,7,EXACTLY
559039136191873024,debates,5,Again
559039142516752384,debates,11,not correct
559039162435502096,debates,18,You SHOULD IDEALLY

559039308015599633,debates,19,Then read carefully

559039333357584384,debates,4,WAIT
559039360457244682,debates,22,LET ME GIVE YOU A TLDR
559039403050270743,debates,21,EVERYONE STOP WRITING
559039455940575243,debates,4,SIGH
559039477272674315,debates,6,Oh wow
559039497564717057,debates,18,Who are you again?
559039552208109578,debates,2,So
559039567962046476,debates,19,Ill put this simply
559039941301239808,debates,488,It is in the best interest of a foreigner to learn the local language_ as it will make their lives easier: they would be able to explain to a local cashier that he wants 2 kilograms of corn flower and not 2 cucumbers for example. The process is for their ultimate good. But if they don't learn it_ that is their own problem. They have the prerogative to do as they wish-try to assimilate *better*_ the key word here is better. You can still assimilate without learning the local language.
559039982661271573,debates,29,Its their liberty to learn it
559039996385034240,debates,9,Or not to
559040035584999434,debates,42,and it will either make their lives harded
559040049090527253,debates,9,or easier
