559039333357584384,debates,4,WAIT
559039360457244682,debates,22,LET ME GIVE YOU A TLDR
559039403050270743,debates,21,EVERYONE STOP WRITING
559039455940575243,debates,4,SIGH
559039477272674315,debates,6,Oh wow
559039497564717057,debates,18,Who are you again?
559039552208109578,debates,2,So
559039567962046476,debates,19,Ill put this simply
559039941301239808,debates,488,It is in the best interest of a foreigner to learn the local language_ as it will make their lives easier: they would be able to explain to a local cashier that he wants 2 kilograms of corn flower and not 2 cucumbers for example. The process is for their ultimate good. But if they don't learn it_ that is their own problem. They have the prerogative to do as they wish-try to assimilate *better*_ the key word here is better. You can still assimilate without learning the local language.
559039982661271573,debates,29,Its their liberty to learn it
559039996385034240,debates,9,Or not to
559040035584999434,debates,42,and it will either make their lives harded
559040049090527253,debates,9,or easier
559040055184850945,debates,6,period
559040094967955477,debates,47,this is the absolute fucking truth. huge PERIOD
