559022398628823070,general-discussions,370,In the case of Ant-Man and Thanos_ if you're not confident in drawing detailed anatomy_ just do enough detail for the characters to be recognisably_ say a bald head with radiator grille chin for Thanos and an Ant-Man mask_ stick both heads on some stickmen_ and the incongruity in detail just adds to the humour of the sketch. It's not laziness; it's a stylistic choice!
559022779194671127,general-discussions,91,Is it something like Haskell's byte string types_ with one being lazy and the other strict?
559031582070013973,off-topic,42,<@153146360705712128>_ I would suspect so.
559031948664766504,off-topic,153,It probably is to do with the fact it *is* on the market and_ as such_ gets advertised so people know about it. GIMP and Linux_ as free software_ do not.
559031998447091751,off-topic,41,<@467576889926483969>_ that is brilliant.
559032242865700884,off-topic,110,If you're going for a comic_ then it's perfect. It has the two key ingredients: recognisability and silliness.
559032719284240400,off-topic,229,Does it? While I'm no pro myself_ I read someone graphic designer's comment that both GIMP and PS have a similarly vast suite of high level tools but cover slightly different areas and_ as such_ he uses both depending on the job.
559038298320928788,off-topic,246,To go back off our tangent_ I just want to say_ <@!242313388963659776> and <@467576889926483969>_ you have both shown yourselves to be talented artists_ for what my opinion's worth_ so next time you feel like drawing_ just go for it.NLPeace out. â˜®
559038605692239893,off-topic,76,There could be many reasons for that. Doesn't say anything about your skill.
559038655801327628,off-topic,64,School courses have to follow a certain framework. Art does not.
559038686243848204,off-topic,26,Never let it get you down.
560998508774162511,programming,282,Not a big deal_ IMHO. In my experience_ if I need to be stringifying a class I'd have worked with it enough to know what the fields are and just need to quickly see the values. Have any situations cropped up for you where it's important to learn the fields from the stringification?
561009509582110723,programming,135,Is it like for case classes with more fields than short term memory can hold so one needs to have a constant reference for their names?
561010394500431872,programming,47,Maybe one could write a macro to sort this out.
561010598662373426,programming,81,I'm kinda curious now though what kind of models have so many optional strings. ðŸ˜›
561011945314975754,programming,121,Heh_ I had a coworker who got pretty good at them because of how convenient they were for shortening certain boilerplate.
