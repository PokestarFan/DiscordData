558819207660175400,34,It may end up as an expansion item
558830928005431313,119,Since the Fishing Hook might come in the pirate llamas_ anyone that has it_ and know if it has any fun/unique #6 perks?
558831980297322505,72,Would it not be super logical for flintlocks to be in the pirate llamas?
558832015999238144,49,Not saying its a sure thing_ but it seems like it
558832328986722324,33,why would they not re release it?
558832630930472977,30,Oh_ thought you meant "at all"
558832718566391820,70,But dunno what they would have in pirate llamas if not flintlocks_ heh
559012452763959325,55,Bllrgh_ setting up tunnels before SSD's is anxious work
559012710289899520,105,ah sorry pyra_ did not refer to you specifically_ have just been building in my SSD for an hour or so now
559012751457124382,78,and I will not be able to know if its any good before I send the husks onto it
559012830247125022,14,Twine number 2
559012872617984011,76,So still even have routes that will be closed off when putting up AMPs later
559109788789637120,85,<@!441823302806142979> So uh_ ozzy_ how many walls can the neon sniper shoot through?
559110060584730664,85,<@!441823302806142979> Alright_ then I should be fine with roofs over my trap tunnels
560964744261926951,54,The current system is loads better than the former one
560964760284299265,31,I think its a kinda good system
560965068083167263,53,The game is ALL about grinding a farming though_ heck
560965222773555201,16,But it's not bad
560975481545949224,30,oh_ you are right_ forgot that
560976061828169728,59,It has the highest range of any pistol i've seen so far tho
560976078450065430,13,which is neat
560976126248353793,31,it shoots farther than most ARs
560976331693883403,92,Jack's revenge is the highest damaging in one bullet....if you use the corsair sword with it
560976933597478940,29,cooldown is just_ way too bad
560977065378185246,5,Rosie
560977085514907658,28,both normal and cannon rosie
560977278541103128,146,They should make both rosies have infinite ammo_ normal rosie can keep the overheat_ make cannon rosie only able to shoot once each 3 or 5 seconds
560977566769348618,46,Or Farm trees instead of ANY of the objectives
560979034784399360,110,im still going to test him with the scythe build_ because I hear it's weakness is slow movement while spinning
560979073883701248,49,if his 50% affects it_ he'd be a beyblade of doom
560979122482839564,55,After getting the hero you get a quest to find "chests"
560979560120975381,46,its quest specific chests with nothing in them
560979698268635178,82,Its a pretty shitty team perk tho_ so you are not losing out much by not having it
560979819924422677,87,Its not that the effect is bad...its what you require to have it on_ same with Boombase
560979974719406113,44,yeezus_ this one went full BR mode real fast
560980385933033492,8,that too
560981179382235138,68,For shrooms_ I find that the blue and yellow chunky ones always work
560981767222329345,61,Crit damage commanders is the meta thing for damage right now
560981782065840129,15,not crit rating
560982183356006456,119,Well as vicc said above_ its probably assassin then_ but mostly because there are not melee crit damage perks right now
560982367305728041,20,"Every melee weapon"
560983041200226315,119,<@243888088491884547> Oh_ and about Rio shot_ I would consider her an outlier_ due to the ridiculous nature of her perk
560983341713588254,76,Problem with swords that I find is they all have pretty boring heavy attacks
560983634279137291,1,v
560983773651402762,45,what kind of right-click does hootsalot have?
560983800935612436,43,I am going to have to think of a club build
560983864399495168,63,I have a golf-club and its...nice_ but lacks zing and shinyness
560984149427486720,14,is gud_ gaming
560984364817580043,53,the new pirate hero is pretty neat_ if you like ROSIE
560984587438784533,121,His rosie is more like a...launcher that once you run out of ammo_ you are not allowed to craft another one for 3 minutes
