558755871488999424,general-discussions,29,<@142242854167642122> tru dat
558755935397347343,general-discussions,33,I used the nitro gift on this one
558756029878501380,general-discussions,21,nah I deleted old acc
558756377275924511,bot-spam,5,!help
558756415552880641,bot-spam,20,what happened to evo
558756761637748736,general-discussions,11,oof windoze
558757414980157455,general-discussions,40,hack all the things_ drink all the booze
558758421457797327,general-discussions,46,zero through three_ we're in every single ring
558758943728599080,general-discussions,37,mfw no one gets the song reference :(
558759391059247113,general-discussions,118,<@115076505549144067> also is hardware a ring? I thought lowest ring is zero cause rings are only existent in software
558759408268607490,general-discussions,20,and cpu manages them
558759422571053094,general-discussions,14,me is hardware
558759465906601995,general-discussions,27,different small chip in cpu
558759473246633985,general-discussions,6,yea Ik
558759961526665245,general-discussions,78,oof I tried to strip the me's firmware but apparently 9. gen cpus prevent that
558760010033790996,general-discussions,38,I had to use buspirate to reflash bios
558760097447280641,general-discussions,48,yeah 9. gen cpus detect that and prevent booting
558760102258016367,general-discussions,8,it seems
558760525882720270,general-discussions,86,only thing I want is Libreboot for 9. gen cpus and It won't be ready in next 100 years
558760934185762826,general-discussions,53,yeah libreboot is coreboot with no proprietary parts?
558761339108196372,general-discussions,44,imagine if intel made their shit open source
558761418724212750,general-discussions,71,but I think something about x86 agreement disallowed making open source
558761636618305536,general-discussions,3,yes
558761683170885661,general-discussions,31,dude there are already exploits
558761704037548036,general-discussions,32,and fixes are making cpus slower
558761738615390217,general-discussions,15,was it spectre?
558762051590160421,general-discussions,143,I can only remember how one of them exploits were working_ it was something about placing sigtrap right in mapped kernel memory security checks
558762108133703685,general-discussions,35,right before security check I think
558762421397880880,general-discussions,58,cause branch predictor executed code beyond security check
558762464507068416,general-discussions,37,maybe not execute but something other
558762489643270149,general-discussions,42,I dunno how branch prediction really works
558762894163050536,general-discussions,59,<@115076505549144067> what do u think about puri.sm laptops
558763190331244571,general-discussions,52,how does it has i7 7500u as cpu and support coreboot
558763255137566746,general-discussions,61,I thought coreboot didn't support anything newer than haswell
558765434535673856,general-discussions,61,is this correct https://coreboot.org/status/board-status.html
558766911685525525,media,95,At least the linux has spears and can do hunting_ nodeos guy can only make shit memes like this
