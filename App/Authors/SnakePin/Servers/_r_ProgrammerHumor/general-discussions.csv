558755871488999424,29,<@142242854167642122> tru dat
558755935397347343,33,I used the nitro gift on this one
558756029878501380,21,nah I deleted old acc
558756761637748736,11,oof windoze
558757414980157455,40,hack all the things_ drink all the booze
558758421457797327,46,zero through three_ we're in every single ring
558758943728599080,37,mfw no one gets the song reference :(
558759391059247113,118,<@115076505549144067> also is hardware a ring? I thought lowest ring is zero cause rings are only existent in software
558759408268607490,20,and cpu manages them
558759422571053094,14,me is hardware
558759465906601995,27,different small chip in cpu
558759473246633985,6,yea Ik
558759961526665245,78,oof I tried to strip the me's firmware but apparently 9. gen cpus prevent that
558760010033790996,38,I had to use buspirate to reflash bios
558760097447280641,48,yeah 9. gen cpus detect that and prevent booting
558760102258016367,8,it seems
558760525882720270,86,only thing I want is Libreboot for 9. gen cpus and It won't be ready in next 100 years
558760934185762826,53,yeah libreboot is coreboot with no proprietary parts?
558761339108196372,44,imagine if intel made their shit open source
558761418724212750,71,but I think something about x86 agreement disallowed making open source
558761636618305536,3,yes
558761683170885661,31,dude there are already exploits
558761704037548036,32,and fixes are making cpus slower
558761738615390217,15,was it spectre?
558762051590160421,143,I can only remember how one of them exploits were working_ it was something about placing sigtrap right in mapped kernel memory security checks
558762108133703685,35,right before security check I think
558762421397880880,58,cause branch predictor executed code beyond security check
558762464507068416,37,maybe not execute but something other
558762489643270149,42,I dunno how branch prediction really works
558762894163050536,59,<@115076505549144067> what do u think about puri.sm laptops
558763190331244571,52,how does it has i7 7500u as cpu and support coreboot
558763255137566746,61,I thought coreboot didn't support anything newer than haswell
558765434535673856,61,is this correct https://coreboot.org/status/board-status.html
560624893515792394,7,Use get
560624984431788062,27,<:Kappa:539192281916375040>
560625159304773632,10,Then debug
560625224731590656,28,Wireshark or developer tools
560625345435402241,10,No problem
560625402247380995,44,I am something of a software engineer myself
560625456005775362,30,<:thinkies:493429957121540109>
560625882809761824,12,What is GRWL
560626095213379594,2,Oh
560626176947912705,50,Oof I thought you meant something software related
560626253082918935,31,Cause it seemed similar to glfw
560626340404002827,24,Yes it's a good game btw
