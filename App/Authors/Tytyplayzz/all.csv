560630380273860609,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,220,<@126841382781321216> I think you should get a job at epic and fix the issues you see because as I see it epic is doing a great job with their company. If you had a game with over 250 million players you would understand
560630889902505986,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,121,Bro shut up. If you don’t like what they do then get a job there and fix it. Also there are 7 billion people in the world
560631007624298497,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,57,I read that there are 250 million people playing the game
560631090616860699,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,34,Then get a job there and change it
560631220875296798,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,53,If people have a problem then go get a job and fix it
560631455433097226,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,94,Ya they hire good people who deserve the jobs. That is what I am saying they can’t be perfect.
560631747813834754,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,39,You make a game as big as fortnite then
560631820451053568,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,51,And you have the best customer service in the world
560632166749569024,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,94,They CANT be perfect holy crap people expect them to be there 24/7 working on you and only you
560632481628291082,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,90,That is their low end but I bet if you were there u wouldn’t be able to do anything sooooo
560632583474642945,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,76,Why can’t people understand that the people working there are only human too
560633284233658408,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,147,I truely don’t get how people can be that naive to think their needs are more important than the millions of people who are dealing with issues too
560633371773108246,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,8,I do too
560634028471091200,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,380,I have had annoying things with them a few times but you are not the only person in the world to have issues. People complaining  so much like they are the only ones who matter guess what I was hacked in season 4 they took my credit card info and spent 500$ with it on their account. I waited for epic to fix my issue which took a bit and now it is solved complaining does nothing
560634487076028453,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,76,I hate how people complain so much. This morning was the update and now this
560634999330701313,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,24,It is also a video game.
560635783006912546,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,180,Look I think it sucks what has happened to you but you have to understand that they work hard so often and put so much effort into it. We all have issues but we have to get by them
560636153317949472,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,23,then dont play the game
560636443874033694,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,87,can you please stop complaining. I WAS ALSO HACKED but you dont see me here complaining
560636594868977671,Official Fortnite,fortnite-general,73,do  you want meto go back like 4 months in my email to show you the proof
