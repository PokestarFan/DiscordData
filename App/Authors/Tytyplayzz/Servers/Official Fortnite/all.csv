560630074282344456,fortnite-general,15,Then don’t play
560630380273860609,fortnite-general,220,<@126841382781321216> I think you should get a job at epic and fix the issues you see because as I see it epic is doing a great job with their company. If you had a game with over 250 million players you would understand
560630889902505986,fortnite-general,121,Bro shut up. If you don’t like what they do then get a job there and fix it. Also there are 7 billion people in the world
560631007624298497,fortnite-general,57,I read that there are 250 million people playing the game
560631090616860699,fortnite-general,34,Then get a job there and change it
560631220875296798,fortnite-general,53,If people have a problem then go get a job and fix it
560631455433097226,fortnite-general,94,Ya they hire good people who deserve the jobs. That is what I am saying they can’t be perfect.
560631747813834754,fortnite-general,39,You make a game as big as fortnite then
560631820451053568,fortnite-general,51,And you have the best customer service in the world
560632166749569024,fortnite-general,94,They CANT be perfect holy crap people expect them to be there 24/7 working on you and only you
560632481628291082,fortnite-general,90,That is their low end but I bet if you were there u wouldn’t be able to do anything sooooo
560632583474642945,fortnite-general,76,Why can’t people understand that the people working there are only human too
560633284233658408,fortnite-general,147,I truely don’t get how people can be that naive to think their needs are more important than the millions of people who are dealing with issues too
560633371773108246,fortnite-general,8,I do too
560634028471091200,fortnite-general,380,I have had annoying things with them a few times but you are not the only person in the world to have issues. People complaining  so much like they are the only ones who matter guess what I was hacked in season 4 they took my credit card info and spent 500$ with it on their account. I waited for epic to fix my issue which took a bit and now it is solved complaining does nothing
