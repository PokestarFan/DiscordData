558458864165715988,Discord of a Wimpy Kid,general,125,<@117361819022131206>_ I‚Äôm the whitest person in the world and I love Homecoming. Into the Spider-Verse is my favorite movie.
558459056059187230,Discord of a Wimpy Kid,general,192,Uh_ I actually just enjoyed Black Panther. A lot of people seem to love it for diversity or hate it because of the fanbase_ but I just like it as a movie_ despite all of the huge flaws it has.

558462010027933696,Discord of a Wimpy Kid,general,35,The ending was super rushed though.
558462284578553858,Discord of a Wimpy Kid,general,268,1) Origin StoryNL2) Heroes Coming TogetherNL3) Heroes Falling ApartNLNLHowever_ everyone who says this forgets the whole thing about the "Hero's Journey" that's been repeated a million times and... nobody cares. Why? Because they add shit to keep it from feeling the same.
