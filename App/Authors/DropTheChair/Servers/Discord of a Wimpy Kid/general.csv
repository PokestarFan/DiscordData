558458115809345547,57,I just rewatched Into the Spider-Verse. 10/10 movie_ man.
558458176274563112,76,I didn‚Äôt cry during fucking Schindler‚Äôs List_ but I cried during this movie.
558458333040738314,104,I mean_ I‚Äôll be real_ that scene where MJ gives the speech on how anyone can be Spider-Man makes me cry.
558458359876157440,8,So good.
558458864165715988,125,<@117361819022131206>_ I‚Äôm the whitest person in the world and I love Homecoming. Into the Spider-Verse is my favorite movie.
558459056059187230,192,Uh_ I actually just enjoyed Black Panther. A lot of people seem to love it for diversity or hate it because of the fanbase_ but I just like it as a movie_ despite all of the huge flaws it has.
558459143644643349,91,(I‚Äôm also a sucker for that Wakandan accent. Like_ everything sounds badass in that voice.)
558459429138333697,96,Anyways_ <@117361819022131206>_ Into the Spider-Verse beat out Disney for best animated picture.
558459493780815893,58,They haven‚Äôt lost that spot since Cars lost to Happy Feet.
558459574403989528,39,Yeah_ that year was shit for animation.
558459736601657394,49,Yeah_ man. Happy Feet won best picture over Cars.
558459781707202560,16,Nah_ not really.
558459813546164233,33,Coco was in the running_ I think?
558459961320144896,68,I enjoyed Coco_ TBH. It‚Äôs not my favorite_ but I thought it was fun.
558460089816580116,61,I‚Äôm only renting Captain Marvel on DVD. It looks so mediocre.
558461147611922432,568,Alright_ so_ here's what I found out.NLNL2003: Finding Nemo wins.NLNL2004: The Incredibles wins.NLNL2005: Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit wins.

558461187147431971,33,That took a while to write out...
558461321159507977,13,Yeah_ it did.
558461527644962827,61,Hating popular things doesn't make you an interesting person.
558461978985758760,37,Avengers Assemble was a great series.
558462010027933696,35,The ending was super rushed though.
558462284578553858,268,1) Origin StoryNL2) Heroes Coming TogetherNL3) Heroes Falling ApartNLNLHowever_ everyone who says this forgets the whole thing about the "Hero's Journey" that's been repeated a million times and... nobody cares. Why? Because they add shit to keep it from feeling the same.
558462473666035715,128,I mean_ say what you want about either movie_ but Captain America: Civil War is nothing like Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.

558463508375666708,17,this bit was spam
558463589015617536,92,Maybe the other shit wasn't_ but that specifically was seven messages in less than a minute.
558463785053061120,28,I mean_ do whatcha gotta do.
558464182673211412,293,I mean_ TBH_ this isn't a huge issue_ I just would really rather not have to scroll back up to read messages that other people sent me_ because <@!195703008410075136> had a reaction to it that caused him to spout seven lines of response... that amounted to "oh wow thats actually really funny"
