558789623791353869,MINECRAFT,minecraft,165,<@470451578713669632> I know a really great free server hosting site. It's called aternos. Just google it. It hosts Java severs_ and even bedrock servers if you want
558789673196191749,MINECRAFT,minecraft,20,How do you use tags?
558789743362572294,MINECRAFT,minecraft,3,huh
558789766158614559,MINECRAFT,minecraft,9,?t waffle
558790046845763597,MINECRAFT,minecraft,270,<@!519658375391346698> Yeah but it's free_ and you can now give other aternos accounts access to start your server. You can also set the player count as high as 100. And your server will stay up as long as there's 1 player on it. I suggest 10 player slots or less though
558790230199631892,MINECRAFT,bot-commands,72,<@!519658375391346698> oof. Why u not able to send images then? Weird P:
