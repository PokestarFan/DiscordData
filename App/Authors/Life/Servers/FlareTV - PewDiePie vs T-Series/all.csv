560633677743390730,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,106,Yeah_ a bot purge revealed that over 10K of pewdiepie's subs were bots back in Feb_ and T-Series was ahead
560633796165238785,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,49,And you forget_ T-Series is an indian MUSIC LABEL
560633891833249825,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,59,If I'm not mistaken this is a PewDiePie vs. T-SERIES server
560633940961001472,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,36,Not a PewDiePie vs. PewDiePie server
560634053041192970,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,61,....I'mma pretend you've been reading my messages up till now
560634178190704641,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,59,But seriously though_ please give T-Series a break for ONCE
560634262752198656,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,64,So BTS and Jackie Chan aren't the only thing that represent Asia
560634332356673556,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,42,Yeah_ I saw_ but the sub count is dropping
560634490154647552,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,26,Boi_ it was 30K a week ago

560635131099086848,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,38,Boi you do NOT know Pewdiepie's fandom
560635424935247902,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,24,It's 6:24 here in the US
560635506098962437,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,52,The racist and memelord 9 year olds still can fix it
560635615746457602,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,56,Plus there's the rich expensive 9 year olds in Singapore
560635675662352405,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,41,And then the drunk 9 year olds in Finland
560636058723811328,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,38,Lol_ we all know that was proven false

560636628712816660,general,59,And unfortunately_ Shuri was among the dead in Infinity War
560636638116577290,general,18,It's not a spoiler
560636668026159139,general,48,It's literally in the theatrical release posters
560636766718263297,general,56,They revealed the theatrical release posters for Endgame

560636960264159242,general,22,Black Panther's sister
560637002295410709,general,42,The one that designed the new suit n stuff
560637103428599849,general,86,And last we saw her_ one of Thanos's kids shoved her off a ledge through a glass board
560637174903472148,general,21,See Elloniya is smart
560637215177441291,general,36,They have nothing to be freaked over
560637312241893386,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,39,Nah_ they are going to get passed sadly
560637355174789122,general,23,T-Series is still ahead
560637395226329110,general,46,But the subcount is dropping a concerning rate
560637458211930143,general,37,Pewds will definitely make it back up
560637491569229847,general,34,Not the subcount_ but the distance
560637567343525890,general,28,Woah actually hold the phone
560637609445949440,general,39,The gap is moving at a snail's pace now

560638035423789102,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,43,You're right_ the Indian kids are waking up
560638175689572380,general,15,I'm on the live

560638488542969906,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,26,I've never seen it so slow
560638609418616864,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,53,It's fitting I'm listening to WayV while this happens
560638748023324692,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,19,(Mandopop boy band)
560638891107942431,pewdiepie-vs-tseries,74,But just the fact I'm listening to Asian music while Asian music dominates
560641264765239297,general,30,Oh I'm BEGGING for you guys rn
560641275242610689,general,6,PLEACE
560641314262089743,general,29,Watch Cyndago and KWP content
560641408558432256,general,55,They are the most quality and amazing channel out there
560641462614753310,general,39,With a really amazing story behind them
560641485557727262,general,18,And awesome comedy
560641618739331072,general,43,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KlgKYW2nIE
560641718194536459,general,56,....you DO know I'm not affiliated with Cyndago...right?
560641764105519104,general,17,(I WISH I was 😄 )
560641808888233994,general,23,I'd also cry if I was 😦
560641843617071114,general,35,But still_ it's not rly advertising
560641992435171338,general,68,Just like how y'all advertise pewdiepie and t-series on this server?
560642082780348436,general,19,Cyndago reference 😄
560642108717924352,general,18,Someone gets it! 😄
560642236489138187,general,63,(Technically Markiplier_ but it IS a Cyndago sketch originally)
560642287357526020,general,55,Markiplier pisses me off so much rb because of that tbh
560642296853561364,general,3,*rn
560642407432192003,general,86,I feel so sad to think that they were actually going to collab with Pewds at one point
560642567729971220,general,40,I honestly prefer Cyndago over Supermega
560642593336328213,general,17,More meme content
560642694687227914,general,49,It felt so awesome when Pewds sent them support ❤
560642746126172170,general,33,I didn't think he cared that much
560642851151675412,general,29,But yeah_ any CyndaFans here>
560642856512126976,general,2,*?
560642933104050207,general,42,Damn they really have faded out recently 😦
560643024624025600,general,50,(Fuck you Game Grumps and Mark_ you broke Cyndago)
560643150977433601,general,75,Jack cared way more and his only connections with them was through tweets 😦
560643243436408843,general,47,It is_ Daniel's death really fucked everyone up
560643298960605211,general,47,It is_ Daniel's death really f*cked everyone up
560643338353770506,general,22,Mark a little too much
560643456624754689,general,27,Those sketches were awesome
560643599931539468,general,31,Can you believe only 352K subs?
560643685939675157,general,68,I suppose that's just as well tbh_ considering no uploads in 3 years
560643771750940674,general,55,But I seriously wish they made a JonTron style comeback
560643888797188097,general,55,Makes me laugh that they have a video that's 5.4M views
560643908367810570,general,27,And the rest barely pass 1M
560643990651928587,general,43,I seriously wish Daniel was still alive man
560644045307641866,general,51,Cyndago would still be pumping out classic sketches
560644072482537472,general,48,And we would've had that Pewdiepie collaboration
560644196273487883,general,49,It still feels so sudden_ everything that happens
560644291786178600,general,42,I wish Kids w/ Problems had as many videos
560644350401445909,general,7,Cyndago
560644403149144064,general,24,Reminiscing shall we say
560644451807264768,general,43,Still one of the most quality channels ever
560644547672145923,general,0,
560644615540310016,general,65,Well the only reason they haven't uploaded is because Daniel died
560644726496296983,general,31,I'm sorry what did you say kid?
560644781076905985,general,37,Fyi_ they upload on a new channel now
560644900052533249,general,25,Yeah that's their old one
560644913507598339,general,25,And so far their best one
560644962945990659,general,59,Yeah but you say no quality content when they still make it
560645029996265483,general,67,He says Cyndago is the worst channel because no uploads inn 3 years
560645096241102849,general,69,Even though they purposefully don't upload because member Daniel died
560645242047430666,general,105,That's like saying any band is better than the beatles because they haven't released anything in 50 years
560645396724973597,general,71,Or any channel is better than marzia because she doesn't upload anymore
560645458741952514,general,32,Wow_ a pewdiepie fan going there
560645474626043915,general,20,How faithful you are
560645566598610944,general,28,Well are you a T-series fan?
560645631509790720,general,9,Smart boi
560645734773424135,general,10,Lose what?
560645771599282176,general,15,What arguement?
560645822942019604,general,1,?
560645843607093250,general,9,Anyway...
560645872468099072,general,67,I feel like Cyndago deserves more respect even from its own members
560645903317204992,general,34,Markiplier really f*cked it up bad
560645974272376836,general,31,Pewds and Jack still support it
560645993981542420,general,26,Jack still follows it even
560646054194970644,general,13,Jacksepticeye
560646217705586688,general,34,But yeah generally it gets respect
560646237037002752,general,18,But Mark says f*ck
560646301750919169,general,18,And Ryan says f*ck
560646360295145482,general,63,And it's a shame really because that channel really impacted it
560646393656770570,general,35,Except their the own members genius
560646443820384256,general,54,Like without that channel_ Mark would've never seen LA
560646503346208800,general,53,Well seen it for sure_ but never would've moved there
560646588050178068,general,80,It's not that_ it's that Ryan really doesn't want to go back to Daniel's passing
560646614016851969,general,19,No it's complicated
560646673349738507,general,80,He wants to do it_ but at the same time_ he knows it wouldn't fly without Daniel
560646757164253199,general,23,So he tries to avoid it
560646814596988928,general,15,It's sad really
560646939473870848,general,97,I mean yeah Daniel was 1/4 of Cyndago_ but I think you should pursue your own passions_ you know?
560646993676992524,general,54,That's how almost every YouTuber got to where they are
560647121770905615,general,48,Ryan just lives a very reluctant YouTube life rn
