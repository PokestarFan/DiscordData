558457400156356639,minecraft,3,...
558458594815770624,minecraft,11,Me neither.
558458737111728128,minecraft,16,I guess it's OK.
558458991391539200,minecraft,79,There are 800 jokes. I'm fairly sure most people could find a few likable ones.
558459091903840326,minecraft,73,The issue is... Even if someone found like 30_ that's still less than 4%.
558459381658812428,minecraft,85,I mean_ I'd expect to find 5-10 good ones_ assuming he's posting fairly average ones.
558459623636467733,minecraft,38,Was there supposed to be a punch line?
558459820211175425,minecraft,137,I think what they honestly tried_ to their credit_ is to make it as widely appealing as their could within their allocated effort levels.
558459907939237899,minecraft,88,He issue is_ in doing so_ people would be expected to each individually like less jokes.
558459970971107328,minecraft,62,And so that takes more time investment and quality to do well.
558460131461955584,minecraft,105,They had only enough quality to just barely appeal to any given age group though_ much less a wide group.
558460214949445633,minecraft,58,Which is why the joke quality ends up so widely appalling.
