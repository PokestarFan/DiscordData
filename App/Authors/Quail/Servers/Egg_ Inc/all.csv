559060286321983508,contract-talk,84,<#455388192674283521> is a nice channel for goofing around with the haiku recognizer

559089197756186624,general,111,Try planting your finger ahead of the path of the drone_ and the little fella will fly right into you. Crash! ðŸ’¥
559089925543165961,general,151,For all the "don't tap" advice that folks give_ it really does feel satisfying to tap an elite drone out of the air. Just press it right out of the sky
559090828581273619,general,148,When I first started_ I missed the regular drones so consistently that I thought they weren't actually separate objects. Gave up on them for a while
559096750514765835,general,145,When there isn't a contract or a soul egg multiplier event running_ I check in about once a day to refresh the doubler and collect the daily gift
559096977090936880,general,77,If you play long enough_ you get to a point where there isn't much left to do
559097663782518814,general,179,One clever secret of the game is_ no matter which egg you're on_ you're actually farming soul eggs. Prestiging is a core mechanic of the game_ and you shouldn't be afraid to do it
559107361927594040,general,17,I agree with that
560286953962995712,co-op-recruitment,253,The legacy contracts coming back into circulation are for everyone's benefit. It's likely the dev edits the goals so that players who already finished them have a chance to play them again to help other players_ as some have wished for the ability to do
560286994832293929,co-op-recruitment,57,You do not have to participate if you would prefer not to
560287706840694817,general,56,Piggy+ is plus one level. Piggyx is a content multiplier
560622784015892480,co-op-recruitment,66,The difficulty rating is for completing a fraction of the contract
560624240487825418,co-op-recruitment,93,<@453725117004906496> Please don't spam this channel. Wait for someone to advertise_ and join
560624371798900736,co-op-recruitment,3,No.
560624962067759105,contract-talk,129,<@453725117004906496> That message is a form of recruiting_ which we don't allow outside <#455385719301472286>. Please be patient
560625332667809801,contract-talk,125,Have a read through our various information channels_ <#455396915731890177> <#455385905499340813>_ and watch how we do things
560626883935338517,co-op-recruitment,180,<@453725117004906496> I need you to chill_ kiddo. This isn't a regular chat channel. Put down one advertisement and then leave it alone. Don't compete with other groups_ don't spam
560627571226836995,general,162,The desperation isn't a good look. The contract is available for 20 days. You'll get it finished_ if you don't alienate other players and get yourself muted first
560628708407246875,general,104,I still think the problem is that he completed the contract before the game registered the PE withdrawal
560629181785047059,general,40,We turn off mentionability between pings
560630881270759447,general,107,I wonder if any of them are part of the group of players who were awarded 2PE instead of one_ that one time
560633133431521281,contract-talk,262,The final goal total has been increased on three of the legacy contracts. When you "restart" them_ the game checks whether you met the goals_ and sees that you did not. Your PE is taken away. It is given back when you complete the updated version of the contract
560633349610274836,contract-talk,257,So it is up to each player to keep track of which contracts they have completed_ and to be vigilant when contracts are released. We will document re-releases_ and the push notifications the dev sends inform which ones are legacies_ but each player must read
560633695694880789,general,207,It's the best answer I can come up with for there being an extra PE to take away. Like the game has found a way to correct this error - though so far PE removal only corresponds to specific contracts etc etc
