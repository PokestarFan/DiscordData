559060286321983508,Egg_ Inc,contract-talk,84,<#455388192674283521> is a nice channel for goofing around with the haiku recognizer
559063485389209600,Egg_ Inc,offtopic,11,They're shy
559077820622700596,Egg_ Inc,role-submissions,2,41
559089197756186624,Egg_ Inc,general,111,Try planting your finger ahead of the path of the drone_ and the little fella will fly right into you. Crash! ðŸ’¥
559089925543165961,Egg_ Inc,general,151,For all the "don't tap" advice that folks give_ it really does feel satisfying to tap an elite drone out of the air. Just press it right out of the sky
559090828581273619,Egg_ Inc,general,148,When I first started_ I missed the regular drones so consistently that I thought they weren't actually separate objects. Gave up on them for a while
559096750514765835,Egg_ Inc,general,145,When there isn't a contract or a soul egg multiplier event running_ I check in about once a day to refresh the doubler and collect the daily gift
559096977090936880,Egg_ Inc,general,77,If you play long enough_ you get to a point where there isn't much left to do
559097663782518814,Egg_ Inc,general,179,One clever secret of the game is_ no matter which egg you're on_ you're actually farming soul eggs. Prestiging is a core mechanic of the game_ and you shouldn't be afraid to do it
559107361927594040,Egg_ Inc,general,17,I agree with that
560286953962995712,Egg_ Inc,co-op-recruitment,253,The legacy contracts coming back into circulation are for everyone's benefit. It's likely the dev edits the goals so that players who already finished them have a chance to play them again to help other players_ as some have wished for the ability to do
560286994832293929,Egg_ Inc,co-op-recruitment,57,You do not have to participate if you would prefer not to
560287706840694817,Egg_ Inc,general,56,Piggy+ is plus one level. Piggyx is a content multiplier

560608994402631692,r/teenagers,general,79,Make sure to accidentally slap her several times during the interpretive dance.
560609166109179922,r/teenagers,general,10,Then strip
560609240893489163,r/teenagers,general,48,Yeah_ little too far over the line. Take it back
560609320119566376,r/teenagers,general,15,Hit your sister
560609690900365322,r/teenagers,general,39,Dropkick your sister into a storm drain

560610355873710080,r/teenagers,general,29,Minecraft good_ fortnite okay
560622784015892480,Egg_ Inc,co-op-recruitment,66,The difficulty rating is for completing a fraction of the contract

560624371798900736,Egg_ Inc,co-op-recruitment,3,No.
560624962067759105,Egg_ Inc,contract-talk,129,<@453725117004906496> That message is a form of recruiting_ which we don't allow outside <#455385719301472286>. Please be patient
560625332667809801,Egg_ Inc,contract-talk,125,Have a read through our various information channels_ <#455396915731890177> <#455385905499340813>_ and watch how we do things
560626883935338517,Egg_ Inc,co-op-recruitment,180,<@453725117004906496> I need you to chill_ kiddo. This isn't a regular chat channel. Put down one advertisement and then leave it alone. Don't compete with other groups_ don't spam
560627571226836995,Egg_ Inc,general,162,The desperation isn't a good look. The contract is available for 20 days. You'll get it finished_ if you don't alienate other players and get yourself muted first
560628708407246875,Egg_ Inc,general,104,I still think the problem is that he completed the contract before the game registered the PE withdrawal
560629181785047059,Egg_ Inc,general,40,We turn off mentionability between pings
560630881270759447,Egg_ Inc,general,107,I wonder if any of them are part of the group of players who were awarded 2PE instead of one_ that one time
560633133431521281,Egg_ Inc,contract-talk,262,The final goal total has been increased on three of the legacy contracts. When you "restart" them_ the game checks whether you met the goals_ and sees that you did not. Your PE is taken away. It is given back when you complete the updated version of the contract
560633349610274836,Egg_ Inc,contract-talk,257,So it is up to each player to keep track of which contracts they have completed_ and to be vigilant when contracts are released. We will document re-releases_ and the push notifications the dev sends inform which ones are legacies_ but each player must read
560633695694880789,Egg_ Inc,general,207,It's the best answer I can come up with for there being an extra PE to take away. Like the game has found a way to correct this error - though so far PE removal only corresponds to specific contracts etc etc
