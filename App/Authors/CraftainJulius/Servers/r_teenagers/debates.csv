559057359456960534,33,it's a factor for the toxic ones.
559057388682870801,45,ive just visited braincels for the first time
559057441577238539,82,most of the "normal" incels are just physically troubled people who can't get laid
559057511466926100,24,using humor as an outlet
559057538012807168,28,a bit unfortunate_ actually.
559057603473309707,15,yes_ of course.
559057611249418250,14,agency exists.
559057623530471450,26,they are not utilizing it.
559057916527640600,134,one point that ive seen and "agree"_ even if incels don't agree with this point. sexual decadency is a problem. incels are part of it.
559057936274685952,44,people need more self-control in their life.
559058030625292290,32,bullying makes the problem worse
559058042612875292,17,it emboldens them
559058178826960896,54,Incels are a part of sexual decadency_ in all reality.
559058217850765352,73,This new openness to fuck whenever you wish gives a sense of entitlement.
559058278680887347,20,not a debate_ really
559058292668891156,30,just a discussion about incels
559058428941565973,87,people who took the black pill and think they lost the genetic lottery in getting laid.
559058893527973898,32,<@557897915188903936> same thing
559060241023631361,6,lol no
559060252897705986,22,not in a million years
559060291409805333,24,incels are involuntary./
559060311420960809,30,they do not have self-control.
559060359432896516,52,if they had the choice_ they'd definitely go fir it.
559060464760389632,40,<@!550993202291802114> issue of mindset.
559060508490334219,63,less of a "mental" problem and more of a philosophical outlook.
559060529214259208,20,it's not an illness.
559060589213646848,40,<@!378627967435145219> NOT what i meant.
559060645119787018,109,If they had the choice to fuck someone and were free to do so_ they will not have the self-control to refuse.
559060823058808833,90,Anyway_ I feel like people focus on incels too much and draw away from the real questions.
559061165880246272,46,Pizzagate was not outlandish at all_ actually.
559061183437733908,22,The theory was flawed.
559061188147806231,10,definitely
559061459229736990,21,so of course its long
559063116416155681,54,<@261177081600147457> thats literally not what he said
559063178433134592,86,he said the "name" was made up by the american left as a strawman against reaganomics.
559063242509385728,52,no economist_ or anyone_ believes in "trickle-down".
559063284419133441,65,in fact_ even political juice is wrong on his "supply side" shit.
559063322495025152,56,there's no such thing as supply or demand side economics
559063338185785359,21,you need fuckin' both
559063368317534245,15,/r/badeconomics
559063448961548289,14,american left.
559063476874641412,52,<@!550993202291802114> he says supply side ECONOMICS
559063522575646740,26,that's a clear difference.
559065287618592792,37,in a realistic system_ you NEED both.
559065460327317506,51,No_ but it's preposterous to be all for "one side".
559065480543993856,41,people calling themselves "supply siders"
559065544209203203,97,you see this a lot among US republicans who support trump tax cuts and reagaonmics_ for instance.
559065562672529430,27,the problem is the polarity
559065589587378198,49,you can't just support one_ that's pretty stupid.
559065753698041886,83,No_ but we should like_ actually use methods that properly apply to each situation.
559065784949932032,19,That's pretty cool.
559065847809835028,16,Cool beans_ then
559065921692631045,51,The problem is people who are vehemently one-sided.
