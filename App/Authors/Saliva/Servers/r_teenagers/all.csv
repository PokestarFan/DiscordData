558858632486322176,serious-personal-2,386,All I want is to know where I went wrong. I look back on my life and things were not too bad. I was happier then_ I was better at making friends/wasn't losing people_ and it's almost like I've given up on things. I don't want to end up throwing away an potential I could have but at the same time it feels like it's all already gone. I don't even know what I need though_ it's kinda sad
