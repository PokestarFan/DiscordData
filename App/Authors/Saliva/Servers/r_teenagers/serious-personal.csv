558860110609252372,53,Why do you ask about childhood? <@388801706076667906>
558861184409927690,186,I mean_ I think missing being a kid is a something to miss_ but I don't it particularly makes you you. Maybe it makes you who you were because you have to change as you get older I think
558861411363717151,95,Kinda like the old you is in the past and the past isn't something to base decisions etc off of
558861620550303754,85,Sounds like you've started living more in the present though if improvement is coming
558861674308960277,26,Failure is bound to happen
558861725898637334,23,Can't be avoided really
558862000453713921,64,Was it like just awfully obvious or bad that you worry about it?
558862193815453717,48,The mistakes that were bad_ why are they so bad?
558862332701310989,33,Sorry_ yeah_ I meant the mistakes
558863317427552258,42,So I can understand: what's the money for?
558863371504451594,15,Ok_ makes sense
