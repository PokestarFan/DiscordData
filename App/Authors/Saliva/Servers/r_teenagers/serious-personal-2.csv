558858632486322176,386,All I want is to know where I went wrong. I look back on my life and things were not too bad. I was happier then_ I was better at making friends/wasn't losing people_ and it's almost like I've given up on things. I don't want to end up throwing away an potential I could have but at the same time it feels like it's all already gone. I don't even know what I need though_ it's kinda sad
558868538350370818,35,Yeah_ I'm on the second part so far
558868574006149132,15,It's kinda hard
558868589344456724,11,But oh well
558868813148454914,21,Original ;) (pfp btw)
560638620227338241,56,Maybe it's about time to turn off for the night for you?
560638741790851072,57,I doubt being here or wherever else you may be is helping
560639263335514132,91,Oh yeah_ reading is good for keeping your mind occupied and writing is good for emptying it
560640216763990026,151,Y'all ever get the feeling that you care too much_ even for random people like on here_ and doing so makes things worse because it always ends in loss?
560640533156855808,109,I'm not trying to say that caring for people is pointless but there has to be some better ending I would hope
560640663071490111,42,Not death_ don't know how to put it really
560640787977732128,58,Like it either dies off_ ends abruptly or some other thing
