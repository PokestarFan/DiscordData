I was happier then_ I was better at making friends/wasn't losing people_ and it's almost like I've given up on things. I don't want to end up throwing away an potential I could have but at the same time it feels like it's all already gone. I don't even know what I need though_ it's kinda sad
558868538350370818,35,Yeah_ I'm on the second part so far
558868574006149132,15,It's kinda hard
558868589344456724,11,But oh well
