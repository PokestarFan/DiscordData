558858632486322176,386,All I want is to know where I went wrong. I look back on my life and things were not too bad. I was happier then_ I was better at making friends/wasn't losing people_ and it's almost like I've given up on things. I don't want to end up throwing away an potential I could have but at the same time it feels like it's all already gone. I don't even know what I need though_ it's kinda sad
558868538350370818,35,Yeah_ I'm on the second part so far
558868574006149132,15,It's kinda hard
558868589344456724,11,But oh well
558868813148454914,21,Original ;) (pfp btw)
560638620227338241,56,Maybe it's about time to turn off for the night for you?
560638741790851072,57,I doubt being here or wherever else you may be is helping
560639263335514132,91,Oh yeah_ reading is good for keeping your mind occupied and writing is good for emptying it
