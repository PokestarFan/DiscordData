558858632486322176,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,386,All I want is to know where I went wrong. I look back on my life and things were not too bad. I was happier then_ I was better at making friends/wasn't losing people_ and it's almost like I've given up on things. I don't want to end up throwing away an potential I could have but at the same time it feels like it's all already gone. I don't even know what I need though_ it's kinda sad
558860110609252372,r/teenagers,serious-personal,53,Why do you ask about childhood? <@388801706076667906>
558861184409927690,r/teenagers,serious-personal,186,I mean_ I think missing being a kid is a something to miss_ but I don't it particularly makes you you. Maybe it makes you who you were because you have to change as you get older I think
558861411363717151,r/teenagers,serious-personal,95,Kinda like the old you is in the past and the past isn't something to base decisions etc off of
558861620550303754,r/teenagers,serious-personal,85,Sounds like you've started living more in the present though if improvement is coming
558861674308960277,r/teenagers,serious-personal,26,Failure is bound to happen
558861725898637334,r/teenagers,serious-personal,23,Can't be avoided really
558862000453713921,r/teenagers,serious-personal,64,Was it like just awfully obvious or bad that you worry about it?
558862193815453717,r/teenagers,serious-personal,48,The mistakes that were bad_ why are they so bad?
558862332701310989,r/teenagers,serious-personal,33,Sorry_ yeah_ I meant the mistakes
558863317427552258,r/teenagers,serious-personal,42,So I can understand: what's the money for?
558863371504451594,r/teenagers,serious-personal,15,Ok_ makes sense
558863966877777921,r/teenagers,serious-personal,251,I mean_ for the project and the friend at least: just thinking about how much those will really impact you is something to take into account. Like if they won't mean much to you later than don't worry about it now too much since it won't in the future
558864073375350804,r/teenagers,serious-personal,78,For the saying the wrong thing that can't be too hard to fix if it's worked on
558864300018499630,r/teenagers,serious-personal,148,For the bird_ sorry to hear_ it just really doesn't go your way sometimes and it's sad to hear about the bird but like you said: what's done is done
558864482403745793,r/teenagers,serious-personal,121,I think that if you know what the problem is (your responsibility it looks like) and you work on it things should be fine
558864858943324181,r/teenagers,serious-personal,45,Been looking around then? Any luck with that?
558865207946903562,r/teenagers,serious-personal,50,Sounds good then_ rev.com is the caption thing no?
558865427300614154,r/teenagers,serious-personal,67,Is the interneship related at all to a career you're interested in?
558865507038527529,r/teenagers,serious-personal,45,Oui_ let's hope you can get enough sleep haha
558865590270427144,r/teenagers,serious-personal,39,Oh good_ that sounds amazing at a ranch

558865730276163586,r/teenagers,serious-personal,42,I love the simple yet fulfilling tasks tbh
558865792628949012,r/teenagers,serious-personal,27,Feels like work I can enjoy
558866313456386094,r/teenagers,serious-personal,52,Doctor stuff smh_ it is a bit much work ain't it lol
558866572475629579,r/teenagers,serious-personal,121,I just like going to my grandparents farm to help out_ I love that lifestyle_ don't care much for the job than the living
558866861215842304,r/teenagers,serious-personal,62,That's a thing? Lmao_ I guess our family just never plugged in
558866951611482112,r/teenagers,serious-personal,30,Well_ at least my grandparents
558867030716186624,r/teenagers,serious-personal,50,Oh yeah_ they aren't like off the grid or anything
558867222391685140,r/teenagers,serious-personal,73,What time is it for you btw? I'm guessing bed would be an option for you?
558867319200415744,r/teenagers,serious-personal,21,Yeah lmao_ not tired?
558867414851256322,r/teenagers,serious-personal,16,If ya say so pal
558867482547322890,r/teenagers,serious-personal,39,It is the weekend so no shaming from me
558867754732486676,r/teenagers,serious-personal,69,Eh_ no need to get technical_ my day doesn't start til the cock crows
558867892406452224,r/teenagers,serious-personal,10,About yeah
558868177388437505,r/teenagers,serious-personal,61,Where are you from? Two hours ahead of me isn't the US is it?
558868268962807829,r/teenagers,serious-personal,9,Wait yeah
558868296032583690,r/teenagers,serious-personal,26,I'm just dumb or something
558868392203780097,r/teenagers,serious-personal,40,Two hours from eleven isn't midnight smh
558868538350370818,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,35,Yeah_ I'm on the second part so far
558868574006149132,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,15,It's kinda hard
558868589344456724,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,11,But oh well
558868738934571094,r/teenagers,serious-personal,102,How ahead are we talking about because if not too far but just like really detailed then yes yes yesss
558868813148454914,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,21,Original ;) (pfp btw)
558868907197202463,r/teenagers,serious-personal,55,Oh no_ I don't have the mind capacity to think that far
558869061052661770,r/teenagers,serious-personal,127,Recently I've been thinking about talking to someone I trust about things and I've thought out multiple conversations with them
558869144137629708,r/teenagers,serious-personal,24,Like it's super detailed
558869287822032912,r/teenagers,serious-personal,25,Yeah_ that's how it feels
558869427190366230,r/teenagers,serious-personal,7,Exactly
558869657524764672,r/teenagers,serious-personal,197,For some reason I feel like I don't want to talk about things so a prominent thing is me walking into the room talking and them not being there_ and if they end up being there I walk away nervously
558869829189238794,r/teenagers,serious-personal,104,If things don't go somewhat the way I've thought it I just change the subject to something I can control
558870114674540575,r/teenagers,serious-personal,49,Lmao you weirdo_ I'd so be a tad confused as well
558870330781728788,r/teenagers,serious-personal,101,When I confuse myself I get like dizzy but good thing is that when it goes away I can clear things up
558870505873211444,r/teenagers,serious-personal,24,Hmmm_ you should do that
558870808517148672,r/teenagers,serious-personal,87,Well_ I guess it's a matter of what's more beneficial to your health: the food or sleep
558871030773579776,r/teenagers,serious-personal,87,I'd preferably sleep if I was tired_ but if I wasn't that tired I might as well and eat
558871398756515840,r/teenagers,serious-personal,55,Like a TV channel so you could semi-experience hobbies?
558871569418420244,r/teenagers,serious-personal,34,I guess I have TV on the mind lmao
558871593325953069,r/teenagers,serious-personal,24,Yeah_ that would be nice
558871630705852439,r/teenagers,serious-personal,34,Maybe head to the feedback channel
558871715149643777,r/teenagers,serious-personal,31,I could enjoy a hobbies channel
558871761710612500,r/teenagers,serious-personal,22,What would it be like?
558872280898207744,r/teenagers,serious-personal,100,Yeah_ that's what popped into my mind_ does sound like something that would fit into the server well
558872629646458882,r/teenagers,serious-personal,50,Ay bud_ I think I may hop off and think a bit more
558872667629813760,r/teenagers,serious-personal,20,Maybe see you around
560638620227338241,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,56,Maybe it's about time to turn off for the night for you?
560638741790851072,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,57,I doubt being here or wherever else you may be is helping
560639263335514132,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,91,Oh yeah_ reading is good for keeping your mind occupied and writing is good for emptying it
560640216763990026,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,151,Y'all ever get the feeling that you care too much_ even for random people like on here_ and doing so makes things worse because it always ends in loss?
560640533156855808,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,109,I'm not trying to say that caring for people is pointless but there has to be some better ending I would hope
560640663071490111,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,42,Not death_ don't know how to put it really
560640787977732128,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,58,Like it either dies off_ ends abruptly or some other thing
560641178777813012,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,106,I really do enjoy my time here_ maybe too much_ and the other person doesn't so it feels my care is wasted
560641759366086666,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,195,I guess_ online just feels so much realer since my family is always on the move and I plan to keep up the tradition and backpack when I get old enough so it would be nice but I think you're right
560642044368912395,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,10,What? lmao
560642283670732811,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,116,I don't need things concrete but just a little of interaction is nice_ "chapter of my life could be you" kinda thing
560642605780697089,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,6,Leave?
560642650949156864,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,29,Where exactly are you leaving
560642683471790081,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,2,Oh
560642690853634049,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,4,My b
560642731865800715,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,12,I saw 'here'
