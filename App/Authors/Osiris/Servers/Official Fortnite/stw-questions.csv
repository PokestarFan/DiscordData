560642016501825537,78,What dont you have from cb? Could take awhile not knowing what you already got
560642209603387403,36,That doesnt show whats in his cb tho
560642604828590082,100,I could tell him to reseaech a gun that doesnt show up on ss1 but he might already have it in his cb
560642808256659466,106,Itd be a lot easier to start with him telling us what "good" weapons he doesnt have that can be researched
560642992197599242,55,Why not use it on a hero btw? You dead set on a weapon?
560643070975016961,61,No dude youre the one not understanding <@257038066177277952>
560643268774330394,181,I could look through his ss1 schems and he could still have the schem in his fucking CB so i cant tell for sure what he does or doesnt have because ss1 only shows your non-cb schems
560643470822342666,90,If i dont know what he does or doesnt have its hard to advise him on what to get_ isnt it?
560643519585452032,29,<@257038066177277952> no shit
560643564371968000,48,<@304435131509374976> yeah instead of using flux
560643654834847745,75,Thr point im making is i cannot tell what you have or not. Using ss1 or not
560644235070537728,170,<@304435131509374976> there isnt much goof that you can research that you probably dont have already. What dont you have from the neon event? Scythe_ sniper are both good
560644829063675929,43,@fakeschoolbus#0864 yeah thats a great idea
560645335840456734,51,<@304435131509374976> probably go damage and reload
560646834608144394,82,<@556890896642211840> save that shit until the military weapons get added to Cb ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
561010186203168788,108,<@465061262599127041> you have to post in the correct format_ if you mess it up you get a 15 minute cooldown
