558444187599765516,47,Fire rate doesn't change the charge rate_ iirc.
558451694917255168,163,<@371471943947386881> It is all RNG. It is up to you to decide what is worth it based on if you need something inside the llama_ or if there is something you want.
558451977424470016,102,I like to get llamas personally_ if they are a jackpot_ or if they have something I have been wanting.
558452198355501067,50,I'd buy those. It is rng for what the survivor is.
558796611103358977,81,<@!440969766203555841> The revolt only comes with bullet chain for the last perk.
558799433584607233,173,<@!160547390653202433> Play with others is not the best way to do your campaign. Just click the mission where it says refuel the homebase. You would be better off doing that
558799817002844170,169,Just cause you start a mission manually_ doesn't mean you are by yourself. People can join you or people don't. It all depends on if people are playing that mission too.
558799968140263426,93,If you party isn't set to public_ then no one can join you. You might wanna set it to public.
558800375403249684,118,As a heads up_ I'm not sure you will get many people to play that mission. I don't think it is a popular mission type.
558800763183431690,58,If you keep getting no one_ you can try switching servers.
558801507785506826,36,Last I remember_ each pellet counts.
558801945331236874,17,That's your call.
558805573907382292,53,Yeah_ as a heads up_ a lot of them say for each hero.
558805916317777927,64,It should be. I doubt they changed the team perk with no notice.
558806181343264778,141,Also_ yes to your second question. That is the only heavy attacks there are in this game. Weapons don't have an alt fire mode that I know of.
558806491096809473,31,I don't think that would count.
558806586957496341,26,That is an ability though.
558806777395675136,121,AMC got moved to the heavy attack for the pick axe. There are perks for it_ so I don't know if that in particular counts.
558807052940476416,89,There are perks for it_ like base. It used to take up one of your 3 slots for outlanders.
558807448769658892,105,Because now every hero specializes on one perk. There are perks for it_ but that does not make it a perk.
558807697663983631,63,They used to be called abilites_ and you boost them with perks.
558807803565703168,64,Loot llama is just loot llama. It had no name or classification.
558807841260175380,31,There were perks for it though.
558808398272135199,73,That is strange. Never thought the pickaxe was considered a melee weapon.
558808436389969920,27,You sure? I'm still in game
558808654296514600,8,Alright.
558809030764527616,40,That's because keen eyes is glitched rn.
558809283060432906,139,<@257356780361744394> Keen eyes is something that lets you see glowing objects through walls as an outlander. It is basically a loot radar.
558809333236760576,54,And yeah it has_ but it never worked like that before.
558809592973361172,112,It even says in the description for in the zone_ that if you switch weapons_ you are supposed to lose the buffs.
558809704101576704,95,The glitch is that it doesn't go away after switching weapons_ so the seeing loot is permanent.
558809962961174528,75,Yeah_ but is will be fixed at some point_ so I wouldn't get too used to it.
558810551090806819,32,What is the mission description?
558810777910247447,62,<@!220947718783238146> Is it the fight the gunslinger mission?
558849701802409995,125,The only idea I got is log in through your xbox or ps account_ unlink the email_ like the right email_ and see if that works.
558850245224693780,117,Look_ either the person is a hacker_ linked and email they don't have access to_ or had no clue what they were doing.
558850604194332683,33,Did you lose access to the email?
558851915426037791,66,If it doesn't exist_ then why not create the email with that name.
558852055096098816,44,We are people. We aren't exact tech support.
558853591566385152,79,They won't. If you can't verify your account_ like you stated_ you are screwed.
558859506940116993,38,What's the command for a report again?
558859820543770634,67,Yeah_ but I do that_ ping the user and then type the reason_ right?
558860078221099009,76,!report <@!271083611351023616> Spamed your mom gay don't @ me in 4 channels.
558860148937064455,12,There we go.
558860174270398471,20,Thanks for the help.
558861140122402818,37,Planks are gained from farming trees.
559062873096192000,221,It all depends on the situation. Base Kyle can make your walls face tank smashers. Powerbase can make your walls heal an insane amount and just take care of themselves. Megabase can give you the biggest base in game_ ect.
559063501679624201,207,Mercury LMG is said to be the one of the highest if not highest DPS in the game. The difference that makes it hard to use is the expensive ammo. You will probably use the Hemlock more often for regular mobs.
559065763214786606,224,Beta storms are experimental modes_ hence the name_ Beta Storm. Those are kinda speculative changes to current mode_ I.E retrieve the data being able to drop ASAP_ or a feedback on a possible new storm_ I.E. test the limits.
559070111281971272,5,!free
559070217175826453,78,<@530001019271118880> Beyond this_ we know nothing about when it will be free.
559089049558712330,128,Well_ David Dean has done playthroughs of it. If you wanna get better at building trap tunnels_ Rounded TikTac has vids on that.
559106124343935017,72,Crystal weapons are just the weapon if you go down the Shadowshard path.
