558444187599765516,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,47,Fire rate doesn't change the charge rate_ iirc.
558451694917255168,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,163,<@371471943947386881> It is all RNG. It is up to you to decide what is worth it based on if you need something inside the llama_ or if there is something you want.
558451977424470016,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,102,I like to get llamas personally_ if they are a jackpot_ or if they have something I have been wanting.
558452198355501067,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,50,I'd buy those. It is rng for what the survivor is.
558453012247609364,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,237,<@416860528292528138> You didn't get banned. It removes the post if it isn't the proper format. Two of the bots in this server should have messaged you_ saying it got removed and that you have to wait 15 minutes to be able to post again.
558463423076368395,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,38,I think they are used in healing pads.
558464124305276938,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,89,They'll be useless to you then. I think they are only used in healing pads and campfires.
558464277791506433,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,53,I feel like I'm missing something_ but I think is it.
558780885579726862,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,139,<@422215028691959838> No it wasn't. The game was announced and delayed for a long time. There is a teaser or trailer from around that time.
558784352121782272,Official Fortnite,lfg-savetheworld-pve,111,I can help you both <@174918548647444481> <@366990681761120267> . My ign the same as my discord. DiabeticDOTexe
558787154218844163,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,22,No you can't. Not yet.
558796611103358977,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,81,<@!440969766203555841> The revolt only comes with bullet chain for the last perk.
558799433584607233,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,173,<@!160547390653202433> Play with others is not the best way to do your campaign. Just click the mission where it says refuel the homebase. You would be better off doing that
558799817002844170,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,169,Just cause you start a mission manually_ doesn't mean you are by yourself. People can join you or people don't. It all depends on if people are playing that mission too.
558799968140263426,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,93,If you party isn't set to public_ then no one can join you. You might wanna set it to public.
558800375403249684,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,118,As a heads up_ I'm not sure you will get many people to play that mission. I don't think it is a popular mission type.
558800763183431690,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,58,If you keep getting no one_ you can try switching servers.
558801507785506826,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,36,Last I remember_ each pellet counts.
558801945331236874,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,17,That's your call.
558803207422214165,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,102,Save the tickets. You might as well since it is just a troll truck and new weapons come out next week.
558803979371544578,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,84,If they announced a pirate llama_ it should come out with a new weapon set at least.
558804126931353600,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,52,Fortnitemares is the only event to not do that iirc.
558804375196401674,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,17,The heartbreaker?
558804505974669323,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,27,Oh_ I didn't see the image.
558804993394868224,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,125,That was done last Frostnite too. I think they just wanted to recreate the old loading screen with the new heroes and weapon.
558805573907382292,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,53,Yeah_ as a heads up_ a lot of them say for each hero.
558805916317777927,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,64,It should be. I doubt they changed the team perk with no notice.
558806181343264778,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,141,Also_ yes to your second question. That is the only heavy attacks there are in this game. Weapons don't have an alt fire mode that I know of.
558806491096809473,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,31,I don't think that would count.
558806586957496341,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,26,That is an ability though.
558806777395675136,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,121,AMC got moved to the heavy attack for the pick axe. There are perks for it_ so I don't know if that in particular counts.
558807052940476416,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,89,There are perks for it_ like base. It used to take up one of your 3 slots for outlanders.
558807448769658892,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,105,Because now every hero specializes on one perk. There are perks for it_ but that does not make it a perk.
558807697663983631,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,63,They used to be called abilites_ and you boost them with perks.
558807803565703168,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,64,Loot llama is just loot llama. It had no name or classification.
558807841260175380,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,31,There were perks for it though.
558808398272135199,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,73,That is strange. Never thought the pickaxe was considered a melee weapon.
558808436389969920,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,27,You sure? I'm still in game
558808654296514600,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,8,Alright.
558809030764527616,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,40,That's because keen eyes is glitched rn.
558809283060432906,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,139,<@257356780361744394> Keen eyes is something that lets you see glowing objects through walls as an outlander. It is basically a loot radar.
558809333236760576,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,54,And yeah it has_ but it never worked like that before.
558809592973361172,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,112,It even says in the description for in the zone_ that if you switch weapons_ you are supposed to lose the buffs.
558809704101576704,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,95,The glitch is that it doesn't go away after switching weapons_ so the seeing loot is permanent.
558809962961174528,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,75,Yeah_ but is will be fixed at some point_ so I wouldn't get too used to it.
558810551090806819,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,32,What is the mission description?
558810777910247447,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,62,<@!220947718783238146> Is it the fight the gunslinger mission?
558849701802409995,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,125,The only idea I got is log in through your xbox or ps account_ unlink the email_ like the right email_ and see if that works.
558850245224693780,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,117,Look_ either the person is a hacker_ linked and email they don't have access to_ or had no clue what they were doing.
558850604194332683,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,33,Did you lose access to the email?
558851915426037791,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,66,If it doesn't exist_ then why not create the email with that name.
558852055096098816,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,44,We are people. We aren't exact tech support.
558853591566385152,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,79,They won't. If you can't verify your account_ like you stated_ you are screwed.
558856738418196483,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,71,Isn't the Riptide a copy past of one of the two base game auto pistols?
558856804482940967,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,43,Yeah. That is the stat copy it is based of.
558858116381540352,Official Fortnite,lfg-savetheworld-pve,22,<@!154747550673534976>
558859506940116993,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,38,What's the command for a report again?
558859820543770634,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,67,Yeah_ but I do that_ ping the user and then type the reason_ right?

558861140122402818,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,37,Planks are gained from farming trees.
559062873096192000,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,221,It all depends on the situation. Base Kyle can make your walls face tank smashers. Powerbase can make your walls heal an insane amount and just take care of themselves. Megabase can give you the biggest base in game_ ect.
559063501679624201,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,207,Mercury LMG is said to be the one of the highest if not highest DPS in the game. The difference that makes it hard to use is the expensive ammo. You will probably use the Hemlock more often for regular mobs.
559065763214786606,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,224,Beta storms are experimental modes_ hence the name_ Beta Storm. Those are kinda speculative changes to current mode_ I.E retrieve the data being able to drop ASAP_ or a feedback on a possible new storm_ I.E. test the limits.

559089049558712330,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,128,Well_ David Dean has done playthroughs of it. If you wanna get better at building trap tunnels_ Rounded TikTac has vids on that.
559090752131563556,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,137,<@!405531123028983808> If you have a lot of weapons_ why not take a pic of the schematics you are interested in upgrading_ and post that.
559090880795901955,Official Fortnite,save-the-world,85,Paintrain is fun. I like the Swan personally_ haven't seen many people use it though.
559094256510304280,Official Fortnite,stw-images,88,I mean_ not really. I have one shot smashers with this. It is for Zenith_ not defenders.
559106124343935017,Official Fortnite,stw-questions,72,Crystal weapons are just the weapon if you go down the Shadowshard path.
