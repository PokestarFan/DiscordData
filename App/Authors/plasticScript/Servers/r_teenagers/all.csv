559038565229658133,debates,37,No one should be forced to assimilate
559038615527882762,debates,30,But people *should* assimilate
559038657604878339,debates,31,It’s in their own best interest
559038677011922954,debates,7,Exactly

559097961389490247,serious-personal-2,50,It would be concerning if you never had those days
559098036530184202,serious-personal-2,75,It may seem that no one else has those days_ but it is because they hide it
559098063491301381,serious-personal-2,27,Everyone goes through stuff
559098092100648963,serious-personal-2,46,And it is that which brings us closer together

559101696488243200,serious-personal-2,42,Except that one friend I was talking about
559101774179336222,serious-personal-2,59,I have said "friend" way too much in the past few sentences

559110228197769226,memes,69,<@250781496875548672> It is one of the most annoying things on reddit
