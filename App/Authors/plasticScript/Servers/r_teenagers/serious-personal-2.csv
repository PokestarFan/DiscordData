559097846213902376,46,There is nothing wrong with you in that regard
559097961389490247,50,It would be concerning if you never had those days
559098036530184202,75,It may seem that no one else has those days_ but it is because they hide it
559098063491301381,27,Everyone goes through stuff

559100323361193984,18,But my friend does
559100546770927643,9,I hear ya
559101064172011557,122,My friend that is on here is my best friend_ so I am fine with him knowing anything I say here. He truly is a good friend.
