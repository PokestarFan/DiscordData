559038565229658133,r/teenagers,debates,37,No one should be forced to assimilate
559038615527882762,r/teenagers,debates,30,But people *should* assimilate
559038657604878339,r/teenagers,debates,31,It’s in their own best interest
559038677011922954,r/teenagers,debates,7,Exactly
559038801478025226,r/teenagers,debates,4,Why?
559038818985050112,r/teenagers,debates,17,It’s their choice

559040544207011851,r/teenagers,debates,67,Why should the government decide what’s in people’s best interests?
559041048207425547,r/teenagers,debates,22,But let’s hear him out
559041493197914113,r/teenagers,debates,30,As <@!550993202291802114> said

559097846213902376,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,46,There is nothing wrong with you in that regard
559097961389490247,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,50,It would be concerning if you never had those days
559098036530184202,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,75,It may seem that no one else has those days_ but it is because they hide it
559098063491301381,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,27,Everyone goes through stuff
559098092100648963,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,46,And it is that which brings us closer together
559098488487673878,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,7,Exactly
559098563791945738,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,38,Plus that last part is super important
559098788027957248,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,55,I am way more open on Reddit and Discord than real life
559098942084874261,r/teenagers,memes,25,<:kms:394349651140018196>
559100048827351080,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,25,Would they know it's you?
559100138698571955,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,68,Just curious on how people handle giving their friends discord names
559100217090113555,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,25,Yeah my friend is on here
559100269770702909,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,60,And I think someone else at my school_ but I don't know them
559100293380309034,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,31,and they don't know my username
559100323361193984,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,18,But my friend does
559100546770927643,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,9,I hear ya
559101064172011557,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,122,My friend that is on here is my best friend_ so I am fine with him knowing anything I say here. He truly is a good friend.
559101098795991071,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,41,I understand not everyone has that though
559101696488243200,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,42,Except that one friend I was talking about
559101774179336222,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,59,I have said "friend" way too much in the past few sentences
559106098418679878,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,26,You could mask your status
559107338620108804,r/teenagers,serious-personal,8,Go ahead
559107405263273990,r/teenagers,serious-personal,2,Ok
