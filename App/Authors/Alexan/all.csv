558766139489124352,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,56,Yeah but who would be able to tell just by looking at it
558766322201133056,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,143,"You use a wooden sword?"NL"Yeah_ but it's from a tree that literally absorbs everything holy around it in order to strengthen itself."NL"...Oh."
558766871596498966,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,88,We meme about it all the time_ but_ yeah_ Quinella did basically nothing sexual to Eugeo
558766918924763162,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,68,Unless his pp got hard seeing her naked but she didn't *do* anything
558770086387908609,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,71,Eugeo only *almost* got wet_ but by then it was already bros before hos
558796167266172948,/r/SwordArtOnline,general,3,Gay
558796474465386497,/r/SwordArtOnline,general,22,*They're multiplying.*
558831280377298946,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,26,The jailbait of a lifetime
558838498422030346,/r/SwordArtOnline,general,32,I don't want to believe they are
558838560086556682,/r/SwordArtOnline,general,59,So therefore they are not. <:smugKirito:290535924356612097>
559049776893526071,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,83,I mean between those who actually speak Japanese and those who have read the novels
559049830312181801,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,86,I wouldn't be surprised if a half decent number of people are willing to watch the raw
559049945580306455,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,26,I probably would_ honestly
559050412645416971,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,43,Well yes_ it is the *anime spoiler* channel
559050568325398598,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,154,And it's pretty pointless to discuss the anime_ even if you see the raw and had read the LN_ without having fully understanding the content of the episode
559050674999132161,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,72,It's just not unreasonable for people to view the raw_ if they so please
559051392128516096,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,57,Well yeah_ no one said they were going to discuss the raw
559051826884771840,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,82,I mean_ the regulars here are pretty certain of the unspoken rules for the channel
559052088009687060,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,217,~~Unspoken rule 34: Although most screenshots of quinella would only be suitable for <#191976650848731136>_ because they're alicization spoilers you can post them here. As long as they're screenshots from the anime.~~

559058250096443402,/r/SwordArtOnline,general,143,And then from that point on it's just him suffering 24/7 so you can't make any comments on her character until basically the last episode again
559070247450050562,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,9,Of Eugeo?
559070278261669901,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,32,I'm actually a desciple of Eugeo
