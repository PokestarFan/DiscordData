558437785942491157,89,It would've been cool if we actually saw that handshake build up throughout the two cours
558766139489124352,56,Yeah but who would be able to tell just by looking at it
558766322201133056,143,"You use a wooden sword?"NL"Yeah_ but it's from a tree that literally absorbs everything holy around it in order to strengthen itself."NL"...Oh."
558766871596498966,88,We meme about it all the time_ but_ yeah_ Quinella did basically nothing sexual to Eugeo
558766918924763162,68,Unless his pp got hard seeing her naked but she didn't *do* anything
558770086387908609,71,Eugeo only *almost* got wet_ but by then it was already bros before hos
558831280377298946,26,The jailbait of a lifetime
559049776893526071,83,I mean between those who actually speak Japanese and those who have read the novels
559049830312181801,86,I wouldn't be surprised if a half decent number of people are willing to watch the raw
559049945580306455,26,I probably would_ honestly
559050412645416971,43,Well yes_ it is the *anime spoiler* channel
559050568325398598,154,And it's pretty pointless to discuss the anime_ even if you see the raw and had read the LN_ without having fully understanding the content of the episode
559050674999132161,72,It's just not unreasonable for people to view the raw_ if they so please
559051392128516096,57,Well yeah_ no one said they were going to discuss the raw
559051826884771840,82,I mean_ the regulars here are pretty certain of the unspoken rules for the channel
559052088009687060,217,~~Unspoken rule 34: Although most screenshots of quinella would only be suitable for <#191976650848731136>_ because they're alicization spoilers you can post them here. As long as they're screenshots from the anime.~~
559052252929720340,11,wait no way
559052270768226324,27,oh this is going to be good
559052686776074242,33,The first illegal site to have it
559052701707796484,32,<:smugKirito:290535924356612097>
559052745953509377,3,LOL
559052830598496272,55,I mean it could still be the first illegal site ya know
559052902984056862,49,~~My source of piracy hasn't uploaded it either~~
559057311872843777,48,*My pirate ship.* <:asunaBun:290536476951707650>
559070247450050562,9,Of Eugeo?
559070278261669901,32,I'm actually a desciple of Eugeo
559073947405123714,38,"...He wasn't cut in half too_ right?"
559075678344052747,48,Unless they can find every "log" of Eugeo's life
559077706776576001,3,pft
559077742952448010,10,oh fuck me
559077751504764928,15,it's so fitting
559077824426934283,68,Since Quinella would destroy half of humanity just to save her world
559078429215948832,55,Kirito just goes straight Hackerman through incarnation
559078462674042935,25,That'd be great_ honestly
559078768795189251,23,you're all confusing me
559078839326736386,52,I mean Sugou is a slender_ intelligent looking Jap--
559078872763858954,10,kouahi why
560979694368063498,103,I'm doing a (primarily) grey scale painting of Alexan doing Vorpal Strike_ modeled after Kirito's in 22
560979721102295061,27,And oof_ I suck at painting
