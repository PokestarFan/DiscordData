559005972312490004,51,<@539066139154841610> you mean in then form ax^2+c?
559006026376937483,25,In that case NLLet b=0 lol
559006167540563971,12,Heyo tetrino
559006255096528914,12,How goeth it
559006456800870411,104,I've been good ty I can leave in like 15 days and I can go back to uni sometimes so that's cool NLPorque?
559006473447931918,25,Yeah this is homework btw
559063111710277642,30,Put your phone and laptop away
559063149412876288,69,Or install something that blocks certain apps if you need your laptop
559078456302764044,83,-1/4 (-2 x + sqrt(249) + 13) (2 x + sqrt(249) - 13) is apparently how you factor it
559088650508304401,22,Is that times or minus
559088812173688835,15,X=6/yNL(6/y)+y=9
559089153338507265,14,do u need more
559089237035581462,30,Again is it a times or a minus
559089308183691297,8,At xâ€¢y=6
559089594872627210,77,well then you have 6/y+y=9 NLDo a little fraction addition to get a polynomial
559089603429269504,8,Solve it
559089707590615060,28,0.725 and 8.274 or something
559089804202213376,57,Them use that for y in one of the equations to get your x
559089824464764948,16,Then just expand
559089840340074527,18,Using a calculator
559094153473163275,71,Thank you! They have a server dedicated to it_ can I DM you the invite?
559094294020096021,64,Also it has physics packages which makes things like \ket easier
