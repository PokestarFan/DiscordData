558427614415552512,77,the only way to find out though is to explicitly ask if bed bombs are enabled
558427644086059018,26,otherwise you wouldnt know
558429651501056020,58,if you try to log in i think it will tell you not positive
558429829800656901,65,that should make it tell you how long you got left thats big dumb
558430175117836298,74,yeah but if you have blast prot you are extremely vulnerable to normal pvp
558430428168585246,66,i mean you still have half the protection of a full prot 4 playerr
558430664563884043,76,if you have 2 things with blast prot you can only survive one bed bomb right
558430798202535937,26,where did you do it though
558430860680888321,24,yeah the hub is pvp free
558430898865963029,24,you bypassed protections
