560962751464341504,save-the-world,134,i don't think i ever ran into a toxic begging child on this game. and thats weird considering I play on open lobbies on vbuck missions
560963213521322005,save-the-world,44,I do like the new mode though. Floor is lava
560963290180616201,save-the-world,50,It reminds me of my Trolling Kids Twine Peaks days
560963509924397087,save-the-world,226,When you would put a Spawn Banner down over the lava pit in a 1v1 and edit the floor to their death. Ruining the durability of all their weapons. Good way to mess up traders. To bad they got rid of Durability loss on death >_>
