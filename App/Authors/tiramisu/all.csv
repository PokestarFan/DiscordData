559076106989338683,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,139,based on the <#490610668345491456> _ i'm honestly surprised that kirito never tried to find logs of eugeo's activity after his return to RW
559077447442759688,/r/SwordArtOnline,sao-only,8,i'm dead
559077571640164355,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,29,it's because nobody's talking

559088863352717334,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,73,because I'll know the whole time what kind of future they're walking into
559089100049874946,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,34,i'll rewatch after finals probably
559089617358290968,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,31,i just have no drive in me left
559089965217349643,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,49,I'll probably watch the next cours but grudgingly
559090689347158018,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,28,it was tactically pretty bad
559091333864751114,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,37,well that was fitting for who Quin is
559096964306698252,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,14,convenient lol

559102046632935435,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,56,it's like how sword golem was made with the memories too
559107355896184832,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,4,well
559107369456631829,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,17,to each their own
559107407809216533,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,51,someone else was complaining about this too earlier
559111235103227916,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,7,yes_ no
559111315449315330,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,9,15 is meh
559111331224092682,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,17,except some parts
559111619511189524,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,79,honestly I read the UR summaries hoping for Eugeo mentions and there was only 1
559111712738115599,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,3,yep
559111758216822796,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,25,Kirito just remembers him
559111776789201029,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,4,once
559111810310209536,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,8,yeah ikr
559111831583719434,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,15,i was pissed af
559111869210820608,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,30,literally Kirito's best friend
559111883676712961,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,4,ummm
559111912722530307,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,33,who said Kirito can't speak in UR
559111917290127422,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,3,lol
559112098487992326,/r/SwordArtOnline,ln-spoilers,51,yeah I honestly could not feel any attachment to UR
559112590253359106,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,67,it's just unrealistic for kirito to not think about eugeo that much
559112691248136192,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,110,I was expecting him to always be like "eugeo would've liked this" or "he would've reacted to this in that way"
559114855983087618,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,104,I'm partly mad because Eugeo wasn't at least remembered as a major hero the way SK and SQ and Alice were
560603032648286216,/r/SwordArtOnline,alicization-anime-spoilers,28,ugh don't give him more fuel
560627966892179456,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,44,^ i'm sorry but i second this wholeheartedly
560628197159600131,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,97,i am so sick of the "another female joins Kirito's troupe" thing that prevails through the series
560628687234531349,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,13,not the point
560628709598691387,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,35,Eugeo would've been a good balancer
560630169711411201,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,49,you're twisting my words into straw man arguments
560630193501503488,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,37,I said Eugeo would be a good balancer
560630200732221440,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,4,why?
560630380491702322,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,150,because we definitely see a very close "bro" like relationship between the two that you would not find between Kirito and the rest of his friend group
560630457407111189,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,70,never did I say that a group needed equal numbers of males and females
560630581164113930,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,20,and I would disagree
560630714312163359,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,59,that Eugeo holds importance to Kirito on the level of Asuna
560630802480758802,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,90,if he were to remain the series_ I would think that he would be 3rd in terms of screentime
560630913097138187,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,25,UR is refocusing on Asuna
560630971905605663,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,44,or at least_ she is much more relevant there
560631041136787486,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,28,based on what we have so far
560631061919301642,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,4,and?
560631126457057282,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,7,anyways
560631173290917898,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,60,I'm not too hung up on Asuna_ so I don't care to discuss her
560631270581862405,/r/SwordArtOnline,untranslated-spoilers,98,I just think that he would add a much more interesting dimension to the friendgroup than Alice did
