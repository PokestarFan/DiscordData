559112590253359106,67,it's just unrealistic for kirito to not think about eugeo that much
559112691248136192,110,I was expecting him to always be like "eugeo would've liked this" or "he would've reacted to this in that way"
559114855983087618,104,I'm partly mad because Eugeo wasn't at least remembered as a major hero the way SK and SQ and Alice were
560627966892179456,44,^ i'm sorry but i second this wholeheartedly
560628197159600131,97,i am so sick of the "another female joins Kirito's troupe" thing that prevails through the series
560628687234531349,13,not the point
560628709598691387,35,Eugeo would've been a good balancer
560630169711411201,49,you're twisting my words into straw man arguments
560630193501503488,37,I said Eugeo would be a good balancer
560630200732221440,4,why?
560630380491702322,150,because we definitely see a very close "bro" like relationship between the two that you would not find between Kirito and the rest of his friend group
560630457407111189,70,never did I say that a group needed equal numbers of males and females
560630581164113930,20,and I would disagree
560630714312163359,59,that Eugeo holds importance to Kirito on the level of Asuna
560630802480758802,90,if he were to remain the series_ I would think that he would be 3rd in terms of screentime
560630913097138187,25,UR is refocusing on Asuna
560630971905605663,44,or at least_ she is much more relevant there
560631041136787486,28,based on what we have so far
560631061919301642,4,and?
560631126457057282,7,anyways
560631173290917898,60,I'm not too hung up on Asuna_ so I don't care to discuss her
560631270581862405,98,I just think that he would add a much more interesting dimension to the friendgroup than Alice did
560631318245933086,3,loo
560631325032448032,4,look
560631382871769110,80,```NLDidn't realize friend groups required equal numbers of males and femalesNL```
560631404355125298,33,I never stated anything like this
560631435241848844,39,but you chose to interpret it that ways
560631443164758028,4,*way
560631465902080003,23,which is a huge stretch
560631506754732047,50,```NLKirito has friends with vaginas_ how horrid```
560631548160770089,3,yes
560631574949920769,41,I don't see what's wrong with what I said
560631629727531049,28,can I not state my opinions?
560631814419644427,105,by "balancer" I wanted to insinuate that Eugeo and Kirito's brotherly relationship would change things up
560631903695273984,96,because it quite frankly is true that the majority of his friendgroup has feelings toward Kirito
560631959844421642,70,and Eugeo is just brotherly with him_ which you do not see with others
560632046154809378,6,vol 18
560632052840529923,5,Asuna
560632105785229344,68,Sinon Leafa intended to state their feelings to Kirito after the war
560632165956714515,62,Liz and Silica stated that they still held feelings to him too
560632178803867648,6,vol 19
560632190476746763,5,Ronie
560632226962735116,37,though Ronie is not part of the group
560632243966443547,16,but there you go
560632359150420009,65,I didn't realize that such an obvious statement required citation
560632434538971136,38,I can guarantee you that it's in there
560632471776002079,37,won't be searching those page numbers
560632535122575361,18,is it not obvious?
560632554735271937,30,for someone who's read vol 18?
560632755117883392,63,didn't realize explicit statements didn't make anything obvious
560635225567395861,40,Shino/Sugu do so when they wake up_ iirc
560635353015386130,14,anyways though
560635437006192641,40,my original point was to agree with pool
560635628283363378,73,and I just wanted to refute the hyperbolic reinterpretation that you made
560635636348878848,12,nothing more
