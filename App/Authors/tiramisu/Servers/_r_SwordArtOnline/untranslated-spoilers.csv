559112590253359106,67,it's just unrealistic for kirito to not think about eugeo that much
559112691248136192,110,I was expecting him to always be like "eugeo would've liked this" or "he would've reacted to this in that way"
559114855983087618,104,I'm partly mad because Eugeo wasn't at least remembered as a major hero the way SK and SQ and Alice were
560627966892179456,44,^ i'm sorry but i second this wholeheartedly
560628197159600131,97,i am so sick of the "another female joins Kirito's troupe" thing that prevails through the series
560628687234531349,13,not the point
560628709598691387,35,Eugeo would've been a good balancer
560630169711411201,49,you're twisting my words into straw man arguments
560630193501503488,37,I said Eugeo would be a good balancer
560630200732221440,4,why?
560630380491702322,150,because we definitely see a very close "bro" like relationship between the two that you would not find between Kirito and the rest of his friend group
560630457407111189,70,never did I say that a group needed equal numbers of males and females
560630581164113930,20,and I would disagree
560630714312163359,59,that Eugeo holds importance to Kirito on the level of Asuna
560630802480758802,90,if he were to remain the series_ I would think that he would be 3rd in terms of screentime
560630913097138187,25,UR is refocusing on Asuna
560630971905605663,44,or at least_ she is much more relevant there
560631041136787486,28,based on what we have so far
560631061919301642,4,and?
560631126457057282,7,anyways
560631173290917898,60,I'm not too hung up on Asuna_ so I don't care to discuss her
560631270581862405,98,I just think that he would add a much more interesting dimension to the friendgroup than Alice did
