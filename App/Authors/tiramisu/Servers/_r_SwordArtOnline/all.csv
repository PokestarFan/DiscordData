558445236289011713,ln-spoilers,83,so i really wouldn't say that ``He dies and gives Kirito motivation to keep going``

559076106989338683,ln-spoilers,139,based on the <#490610668345491456> _ i'm honestly surprised that kirito never tried to find logs of eugeo's activity after his return to RW
559077447442759688,sao-only,8,i'm dead
559077571640164355,alicization-anime-spoilers,29,it's because nobody's talking

559088863352717334,alicization-anime-spoilers,73,because I'll know the whole time what kind of future they're walking into
559089100049874946,alicization-anime-spoilers,34,i'll rewatch after finals probably
559089617358290968,alicization-anime-spoilers,31,i just have no drive in me left
559089965217349643,alicization-anime-spoilers,49,I'll probably watch the next cours but grudgingly
559090689347158018,alicization-anime-spoilers,28,it was tactically pretty bad
559091333864751114,alicization-anime-spoilers,37,well that was fitting for who Quin is

559107369456631829,alicization-anime-spoilers,17,to each their own
559107407809216533,alicization-anime-spoilers,51,someone else was complaining about this too earlier
559111235103227916,alicization-anime-spoilers,7,yes_ no
559111315449315330,ln-spoilers,9,15 is meh
559111331224092682,ln-spoilers,17,except some parts
559111619511189524,ln-spoilers,79,honestly I read the UR summaries hoping for Eugeo mentions and there was only 1
559111712738115599,ln-spoilers,3,yep
559111758216822796,ln-spoilers,25,Kirito just remembers him
559111776789201029,ln-spoilers,4,once
559111810310209536,ln-spoilers,8,yeah ikr
559111831583719434,ln-spoilers,15,i was pissed af
559111869210820608,ln-spoilers,30,literally Kirito's best friend
559111883676712961,ln-spoilers,4,ummm
559111912722530307,ln-spoilers,33,who said Kirito can't speak in UR
559111917290127422,ln-spoilers,3,lol
559112098487992326,ln-spoilers,51,yeah I honestly could not feel any attachment to UR
559112590253359106,untranslated-spoilers,67,it's just unrealistic for kirito to not think about eugeo that much
559112691248136192,untranslated-spoilers,110,I was expecting him to always be like "eugeo would've liked this" or "he would've reacted to this in that way"
559114855983087618,untranslated-spoilers,104,I'm partly mad because Eugeo wasn't at least remembered as a major hero the way SK and SQ and Alice were
560603032648286216,alicization-anime-spoilers,28,ugh don't give him more fuel
560627966892179456,untranslated-spoilers,44,^ i'm sorry but i second this wholeheartedly
560628197159600131,untranslated-spoilers,97,i am so sick of the "another female joins Kirito's troupe" thing that prevails through the series
560628687234531349,untranslated-spoilers,13,not the point
560628709598691387,untranslated-spoilers,35,Eugeo would've been a good balancer
560630169711411201,untranslated-spoilers,49,you're twisting my words into straw man arguments
560630193501503488,untranslated-spoilers,37,I said Eugeo would be a good balancer
560630200732221440,untranslated-spoilers,4,why?
560630380491702322,untranslated-spoilers,150,because we definitely see a very close "bro" like relationship between the two that you would not find between Kirito and the rest of his friend group
560630457407111189,untranslated-spoilers,70,never did I say that a group needed equal numbers of males and females
560630581164113930,untranslated-spoilers,20,and I would disagree
560630714312163359,untranslated-spoilers,59,that Eugeo holds importance to Kirito on the level of Asuna
560630802480758802,untranslated-spoilers,90,if he were to remain the series_ I would think that he would be 3rd in terms of screentime
560630913097138187,untranslated-spoilers,25,UR is refocusing on Asuna
560630971905605663,untranslated-spoilers,44,or at least_ she is much more relevant there
560631041136787486,untranslated-spoilers,28,based on what we have so far
560631061919301642,untranslated-spoilers,4,and?
560631126457057282,untranslated-spoilers,7,anyways
560631173290917898,untranslated-spoilers,60,I'm not too hung up on Asuna_ so I don't care to discuss her
560631270581862405,untranslated-spoilers,98,I just think that he would add a much more interesting dimension to the friendgroup than Alice did
560631318245933086,untranslated-spoilers,3,loo
560631325032448032,untranslated-spoilers,4,look
560631382871769110,untranslated-spoilers,80,```NLDidn't realize friend groups required equal numbers of males and femalesNL```
560631404355125298,untranslated-spoilers,33,I never stated anything like this
560631435241848844,untranslated-spoilers,39,but you chose to interpret it that ways
560631443164758028,untranslated-spoilers,4,*way
560631465902080003,untranslated-spoilers,23,which is a huge stretch
560631506754732047,untranslated-spoilers,50,```NLKirito has friends with vaginas_ how horrid```
560631548160770089,untranslated-spoilers,3,yes
560631574949920769,untranslated-spoilers,41,I don't see what's wrong with what I said
560631629727531049,untranslated-spoilers,28,can I not state my opinions?
560631814419644427,untranslated-spoilers,105,by "balancer" I wanted to insinuate that Eugeo and Kirito's brotherly relationship would change things up
560631903695273984,untranslated-spoilers,96,because it quite frankly is true that the majority of his friendgroup has feelings toward Kirito
560631959844421642,untranslated-spoilers,70,and Eugeo is just brotherly with him_ which you do not see with others
560632046154809378,untranslated-spoilers,6,vol 18
560632052840529923,untranslated-spoilers,5,Asuna
560632105785229344,untranslated-spoilers,68,Sinon Leafa intended to state their feelings to Kirito after the war
560632165956714515,untranslated-spoilers,62,Liz and Silica stated that they still held feelings to him too
560632178803867648,untranslated-spoilers,6,vol 19
560632190476746763,untranslated-spoilers,5,Ronie
560632226962735116,untranslated-spoilers,37,though Ronie is not part of the group
560632243966443547,untranslated-spoilers,16,but there you go
560632359150420009,untranslated-spoilers,65,I didn't realize that such an obvious statement required citation
560632434538971136,untranslated-spoilers,38,I can guarantee you that it's in there
560632471776002079,untranslated-spoilers,37,won't be searching those page numbers
560632535122575361,untranslated-spoilers,18,is it not obvious?
560632554735271937,untranslated-spoilers,30,for someone who's read vol 18?
560632755117883392,untranslated-spoilers,63,didn't realize explicit statements didn't make anything obvious
560635225567395861,untranslated-spoilers,40,Shino/Sugu do so when they wake up_ iirc
560635353015386130,untranslated-spoilers,14,anyways though
560635437006192641,untranslated-spoilers,40,my original point was to agree with pool
560635628283363378,untranslated-spoilers,73,and I just wanted to refute the hyperbolic reinterpretation that you made
560635636348878848,untranslated-spoilers,12,nothing more
560636555874664478,untranslated-spoilers,11,was it not?
560636601492045836,untranslated-spoilers,66,you thought i meant that it was bad that kirito had female friends
560636706961752064,untranslated-spoilers,66,and that friend groups required physical_ numerical gender balance
560636792101928971,untranslated-spoilers,3,yes
560636796522856458,untranslated-spoilers,2,so
560636832505790484,untranslated-spoilers,27,hyperbolic reinterpretation
560636933076811786,untranslated-spoilers,110,it's such a dubious thought process that I'm confused why you at least didn't give me the benefit of the doubt
560637066011082772,untranslated-spoilers,88,what kind of person would genuinely just think that Kirito having female friends is bad?
560637245707780126,untranslated-spoilers,24,I said it was hyperbolic
560637315748462612,untranslated-spoilers,104,because you immediately jumped on my statement by saying that Kirito having friends with vaginas was bad
560637530353958912,untranslated-spoilers,58,yes_ so you immediately figured I was one of those people?
560637811653476352,untranslated-spoilers,158,additionally_ it's that your statements reinterpreted mine as "Kirito having female friends is bad" and "groups need to be perfectly balanced in gender count"
560637867118952506,untranslated-spoilers,52,*that* is the true leap of logic I do not understand
560637887192891392,untranslated-spoilers,12,additionally
560637904896917506,untranslated-spoilers,20,Eugeo is a sole male
560637964057575439,untranslated-spoilers,52,how would adding him contribute to numerical balance
560638067556483073,untranslated-spoilers,89,logically_ I would think that the balance would be because of his bro-to-bro relationship
560638115191193625,untranslated-spoilers,50,that you obviously don't find with the other girls
560638645644558351,untranslated-spoilers,105,I personally would disagree_ but as I think you at least know what my original intention is_ I'll drop it
560955400980267038,ln-spoilers,11,16300 yen ðŸ˜­
560955456768704535,ln-spoilers,24,probably around 160 USD?

560955673102516224,untranslated-spoilers,24,it's not a love triangle

560979638856318987,untranslated-spoilers,4,only
560981892334354473,sao-games,23,that sounds kinda basic
560981918502354944,sao-games,34,and also that sounds like no Eugeo
560982099918585866,sao-games,10,Eugeko pls
