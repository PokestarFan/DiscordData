558470576058925077,67,The Bedrock version has cross-play (mobile_ Win10_ Xbox One_ Swich)

558471395584245796,68,<@515718876533751808> I don't know. I hope so_ but that's up to Sony
558471429583142924,47,<@!104674953382612992> They made their own pack
558471949785759754,184,<@515718876533751808> I don't think that's how it works. For now Mojang still offers and updates the current version. If Sony gives the thumbs up for Bedrock_ Mojang will work on that.
558472122150682642,78,Bedrock is the cross-play edition for mobile_ Windows 10_ Xbox One_ and Switch
558472265449340930,84,"Bedrock" is the name of the engine and codebase_ but we just call it that for short

558772685723795458,152,<@!224569318535331841> I haven't_ but it wouldn't be that surprising if there's some early work that was done in the past just in case Sony every agreed
558772998086328326,172,<@!224569318535331841> Oh_ I have no idea. I was just saying it wouldn't be surprising or uncommon if there was some early work done. Doesn't mean it is or isn't happening.
