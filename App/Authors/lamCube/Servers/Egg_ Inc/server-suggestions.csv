558769104975167489,86,Considering that it was recently changed to make it more compact and less space hogger
558769409225785344,97,I preferred the rate in parenthesis_ more separated from the egg value_ but it's ok also this way
558769642043342868,84,In fact I not complained (at least as far as I can remember) when you did the change
558769742903509012,38,all the others were a huge improvement
558778325804253227,52,is there a logic in the different colors for players
558778582030221339,49,I refer to swift_ where there is a mixed coloring
558778784527024139,128,I understand coloring either [ ]  or the unknowns_ but the mixed coloring is nice looking but... THEY will ask you the rationale
558778800016719912,16,and the numbers?
558779526511984699,108,bah. perhaps ini_ that is like it is now_ with the  [ ] colored... I do not think we need color in the text.
558779637686206484,95,The others are just a shift in the color palette_ but the effect might depend on the user theme
558779743000854528,30,better not to mess with themes
558780514740207645,138,I use the dark theme on the computer. Now I switched on light_ and I'm blinded ðŸ˜ƒ I do not know how good would be orange or green on white.
558780584059731998,18,if they stay fixed
558785872523296769,22,```swiftNLtextNLtextNL```
558786037682274306,27,```cssNLtextNLtext saaaaaNL```
558786096805183489,16,css is ... green
558786208365543445,25,```yamlNLtext for yamlNL```
558786337428471809,23,```fixNLtext for fixNL```
558786452222378014,51,They are ok_ probably already toned for both themes
558788198122258452,65,You could A/B activate yaml or fix_ and see the people reaction ðŸ˜ƒ
