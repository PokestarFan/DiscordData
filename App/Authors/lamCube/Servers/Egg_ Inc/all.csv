558433027596877825,contract-talk,7,or both
558437396010500109,contract-talk,245,To trigger a backup you just need to do some meaningful action changing your farm state_ like buying something_ or hitting a few drones_ or toggling some configuration. Visit the privacy & data page until you see a backup in the last few seconds
558437440457801748,contract-talk,37,being connected to the Internet helps
558769104975167489,server-suggestions,86,Considering that it was recently changed to make it more compact and less space hogger
558769409225785344,server-suggestions,97,I preferred the rate in parenthesis_ more separated from the egg value_ but it's ok also this way
558769642043342868,server-suggestions,84,In fact I not complained (at least as far as I can remember) when you did the change
558769742903509012,server-suggestions,38,all the others were a huge improvement
558778325804253227,server-suggestions,52,is there a logic in the different colors for players
558778582030221339,server-suggestions,49,I refer to swift_ where there is a mixed coloring
558778784527024139,server-suggestions,128,I understand coloring either [ ]  or the unknowns_ but the mixed coloring is nice looking but... THEY will ask you the rationale
558778800016719912,server-suggestions,16,and the numbers?
558779526511984699,server-suggestions,108,bah. perhaps ini_ that is like it is now_ with the  [ ] colored... I do not think we need color in the text.
558779637686206484,server-suggestions,95,The others are just a shift in the color palette_ but the effect might depend on the user theme
558779743000854528,server-suggestions,30,better not to mess with themes
558780514740207645,server-suggestions,138,I use the dark theme on the computer. Now I switched on light_ and I'm blinded ðŸ˜ƒ I do not know how good would be orange or green on white.
558780584059731998,server-suggestions,18,if they stay fixed
558785872523296769,server-suggestions,22,```swiftNLtextNLtextNL```
558786037682274306,server-suggestions,27,```cssNLtextNLtext saaaaaNL```
558786096805183489,server-suggestions,16,css is ... green
558786208365543445,server-suggestions,25,```yamlNLtext for yamlNL```
558786337428471809,server-suggestions,23,```fixNLtext for fixNL```
558786452222378014,server-suggestions,51,They are ok_ probably already toned for both themes
558788198122258452,server-suggestions,65,You could A/B activate yaml or fix_ and see the people reaction ðŸ˜ƒ
560285887926239237,contract-talk,28,Found it. Really forgettable
560286845288579073,contract-talk,17,Different prizes?
560287139489906728,general,41,The prizes for Habitapull seem different.
560287433397239828,general,84,No_ probably the same. Can't remember if the piggy+ is piggy level or piggy increase
560287719155171339,contract-talk,58,Second was +2 transportations. I see it's transportations.
560287921668751391,contract-talk,105,First was +10000GE_ but I can't remember if the piggy+ is leveling or additional GE. Tomorrow we will see
560288240905617410,contract-talk,50,So they were both late August_ graviton and fusion
560288475371536435,contract-talk,25,Ok_ let's bite the bullet
560626585443631104,general,272,I was referring to the fact that_ as far as I recall_  the dynamic balance check of PEs was added to the game because cheaters where multiplying PEs_ so that the developer had to introduce the sanity check that the number of PE was to be derived by the completed contracts
560626732932136961,general,52,So_ now_ when contracts change_ the PE number change
560626823139164160,general,41,Perhaps_ if people were not abusing it...
560627017289170955,general,52,it's not c.laid_ otherwise you cannot complete coops
560627114274062346,general,27,it's 'c.max_reached_target'
560627264266567704,general,66,Seriously_ I was thinking about it today_ and I checked the data ðŸ˜ƒ
560628449736392725,general,234,About the lost PE of the "glitcher"_ I think it's possible that by changing the time_ that person finished in a state in which the contract was expired but the goal was not reached. So the contract registered as completed_ and failed.
