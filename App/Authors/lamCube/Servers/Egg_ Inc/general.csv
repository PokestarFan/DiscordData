560287433397239828,84,No_ probably the same. Can't remember if the piggy+ is piggy level or piggy increase
560626585443631104,272,I was referring to the fact that_ as far as I recall_  the dynamic balance check of PEs was added to the game because cheaters where multiplying PEs_ so that the developer had to introduce the sanity check that the number of PE was to be derived by the completed contracts
560626732932136961,52,So_ now_ when contracts change_ the PE number change
560626823139164160,41,Perhaps_ if people were not abusing it...
560627017289170955,52,it's not c.laid_ otherwise you cannot complete coops
560627114274062346,27,it's 'c.max_reached_target'

560628449736392725,234,About the lost PE of the "glitcher"_ I think it's possible that by changing the time_ that person finished in a state in which the contract was expired but the goal was not reached. So the contract registered as completed_ and failed.
560630417057775634,153,Talking about missing PE_ there are also a few people complaining about losing 3 PE instead of 2... and in they were playing regularly_ it's very strange
560632721618239508,79,The 2PE->1PE contract was the one at the end of December. These were iin August
560633049956483094,59,Unless there was a similar issue then_ and nobody realized.
560634769918918666,76,I found a message from Andy on 27 December_ so the one released on that date
