558433027596877825,Egg_ Inc,contract-talk,7,or both
558437396010500109,Egg_ Inc,contract-talk,245,To trigger a backup you just need to do some meaningful action changing your farm state_ like buying something_ or hitting a few drones_ or toggling some configuration. Visit the privacy & data page until you see a backup in the last few seconds
558437440457801748,Egg_ Inc,contract-talk,37,being connected to the Internet helps
558769104975167489,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,86,Considering that it was recently changed to make it more compact and less space hogger
558769409225785344,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,97,I preferred the rate in parenthesis_ more separated from the egg value_ but it's ok also this way
558769642043342868,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,84,In fact I not complained (at least as far as I can remember) when you did the change
558769742903509012,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,38,all the others were a huge improvement
558778325804253227,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,52,is there a logic in the different colors for players

558778800016719912,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,16,and the numbers?
558779526511984699,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,108,bah. perhaps ini_ that is like it is now_ with the  [ ] colored... I do not think we need color in the text.
558779637686206484,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,95,The others are just a shift in the color palette_ but the effect might depend on the user theme
558779743000854528,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,30,better not to mess with themes
558780514740207645,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,138,I use the dark theme on the computer. Now I switched on light_ and I'm blinded ðŸ˜ƒ I do not know how good would be orange or green on white.
558780584059731998,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,18,if they stay fixed

558786452222378014,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,51,They are ok_ probably already toned for both themes
558788198122258452,Egg_ Inc,server-suggestions,65,You could A/B activate yaml or fix_ and see the people reaction ðŸ˜ƒ
560285887926239237,Egg_ Inc,contract-talk,28,Found it. Really forgettable

560287139489906728,Egg_ Inc,general,41,The prizes for Habitapull seem different.

560287921668751391,Egg_ Inc,contract-talk,105,First was +10000GE_ but I can't remember if the piggy+ is leveling or additional GE. Tomorrow we will see

560288475371536435,Egg_ Inc,contract-talk,25,Ok_ let's bite the bullet
560626585443631104,Egg_ Inc,general,272,I was referring to the fact that_ as far as I recall_  the dynamic balance check of PEs was added to the game because cheaters where multiplying PEs_ so that the developer had to introduce the sanity check that the number of PE was to be derived by the completed contracts
