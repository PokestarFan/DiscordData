558457449137438722,/r/Anime Discord!,games,119,I have it preloaded and everything but I won't be home until like 7 PM tomorrow so it'll be a painful day of waiting :(
558756547543564289,/r/Anime Discord!,games,126,i just had my first encounter with the || Giant Serpent where it tries to eat you || and I just kinda panic jumped off the map
558756569811255320,/r/Anime Discord!,games,29,this game makes me very jumpy
558762775095148555,/r/Anime Discord!,games,260,anyone know if there's a drawback to enhancing attack power by || confronting memories of i assume main bosses? like with DS you could use boss souls to create weapons so I'm hesitant to just outright use this option in case I'd need them for something else ||
558790554381713458,/r/Anime Discord!,games,285,for the runback to the bull you can just go right side up the wall where i think the first group of 2 enemies is and then grapple on top and drop down onto the 2 guys in front of the bull room_ that way those 2 and the guys in the bull room are the only ones you'll have to worry about
558791536041656323,/r/Anime Discord!,games,64,in that case the dogs and such shouldn't be following you though
558791582829248522,/r/Anime Discord!,games,74,even if you had them on you before you'd lose them when you're grappled up
558792917179826204,/r/Anime Discord!,games,150,i feel like i probably just explained it badly_ you can go across the right side and skip any chance of getting in the way of the hammer guys entirely
