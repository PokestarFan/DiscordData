559018610421399564,builds,96,I like them simple but not too simple. Usually a small/medium house with a good amount of detail
559021115079524401,builds,86,All the grinding needed in survival to do stuff like that is really discouraging to me
559021252220682240,builds,83,Sure_ it's more rewarding_ but I don't like having to do all the tedious collecting
559021668618469404,builds,210,The furthest survival I think I've made it in recent times would be a custom Skyblock map me and a friend made. We wrote down 50 unique achievements in a book and saved it_ which really helped keep the pace up.
559021962521870336,builds,68,It was_ although it died off eventually ~~just like our friendship~~
559022320644259880,builds,84,At first it did_ but generally I'm glad I ditched him and moved on to better friends

559022630569639936,builds,63,It was a complicated relationship. Not sure where he stands now
559022831653093426,builds,107,Occasionally I miss it or feel bad for him_ but honestly there's been so much less drama without him around
559022936665620480,builds,27,~~Building my friendships~~
559078308168597508,builds,31,I have mixed feelings with them
559078435952263178,builds,84,I like some of the new textures but others are definitely gonna take getting used to
559078759505068034,builds,45,This was my first impressions of the textures
