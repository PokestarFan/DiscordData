558833919814795275,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,223,Does anyone else not leave their house fearing you'd get hit by a truck and not live long enough to see that one upcoming anime you've been waiting for? Well_ I know I'd get isekai-d if that happened but that'd be too soon.

558834667239899136,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,447,My great-grandfather fought in Russo-Japanese war. He was a Russian cavalry officer_ so he had to kill Japanese soldiers. Washing off blood from hands is impossible_ so while he did *things with his right hand*_ the Nippon blood mixed in with his *white stuff* and so_ my grandfather was born with partial Japanese blood_ therefore making me partially Japanese and thus qualified to get isekai-d (even if that ridiculous of a requirement is true).

558841975353376798,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,213,Have you ever binged so much anime that after being awake for 40 hours you fell asleep and saw more anime in your dreams basically rewatching all the shows you just watched and cementing it in your memory forever?
558847332179902504,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,479,So what happens when isekai protagonist doesn't die and gets transported? Isn't sudden disappearance weird or something_ like if he went into a library and never left it. There must have been cameras around and it'd at least be seen as weird right? Or disappearing right in front of a shop_ most shops have cameras that way. I want to once see isekai with "real world" scenes and people reacting to disappearance and also family dealing with the disappearance of the protagonist.
