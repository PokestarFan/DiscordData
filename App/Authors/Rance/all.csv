558833919814795275,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,223,Does anyone else not leave their house fearing you'd get hit by a truck and not live long enough to see that one upcoming anime you've been waiting for? Well_ I know I'd get isekai-d if that happened but that'd be too soon.
558834213550424096,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,37,Why do you have to kill my hopes snow
558834667239899136,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,447,My great-grandfather fought in Russo-Japanese war. He was a Russian cavalry officer_ so he had to kill Japanese soldiers. Washing off blood from hands is impossible_ so while he did *things with his right hand*_ the Nippon blood mixed in with his *white stuff* and so_ my grandfather was born with partial Japanese blood_ therefore making me partially Japanese and thus qualified to get isekai-d (even if that ridiculous of a requirement is true).

558847332179902504,/r/Anime Discord!,anime,479,So what happens when isekai protagonist doesn't die and gets transported? Isn't sudden disappearance weird or something_ like if he went into a library and never left it. There must have been cameras around and it'd at least be seen as weird right? Or disappearing right in front of a shop_ most shops have cameras that way. I want to once see isekai with "real world" scenes and people reacting to disappearance and also family dealing with the disappearance of the protagonist.
