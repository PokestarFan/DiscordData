558474028973555724,94,<@333606016413466624> its never gonna be good because they will never bring back the og skins.
558474126810152961,42,OG exclusive skins is what ruins the game.
558474270234247178,77,No. They always cater the crybabies to be spoon feeding the rare skin owners.
558783920167190531,9,Horrible.
558803845438767105,134,People still ask for Renegade Raider to return to the item shop and I already lost my faith for them returning it. Just quit the game.
558803940741742651,11,It is deep.
558804190420271106,60,Every item shop is trash. They need the old skins to return.
558805330620973097,33,I thought so too but I guess noy.
559050760315207681,90,<@463480278686498828> we don't know for sure because epic is being a little iffy about it.

560286034353586177,68,Imagine bring back battle pass skins for $100 each at the item shop.
560286861889896478,103,Battle pass cosmetics is pay to win... It remains exclusive and people can't get them after the sesson.

560600320212860938,96,If people say its just cosmetics. Why can't we allow Epic Games to return battle pass cosmetics?
560600805498159106,217,Them: "Its just cosmetics."NLNLMe: "So let them bring back Renegade Raider and My Black Knight."NLNLThem: "Are you fucking insane? Epic Games is not gonna return those."NLNLMe: "But I thought YOU said its "Just" cosmetics."
560601036973146114,80,I keep arguing with people about tuis and most of them just don't get the point.
560601360517824512,57,Let me tell you guys another good story from awhile back.
560602271076057091,111,I want to see Assault Trooper's second outfit varient from Save the World. It would make up my little dwelling.
560607029433991194,116,Black Knight owners: "NO THEY FUCKING BROUGHT BACK MY OG BLACK KNIGHT. IM QUITTING THIS GAME. I FEEL SO RIPPED OFF."
560608103046053916,137,<@207315320313085952> kinda true but the thing is... I like the classic skins regardless. Survival specialist is a season 1 classic skin.
560608330914201609,205,<@524257728944668686> litterly anything could happen to battle pass skins. Sparkle Specialist returned as a boogie down reward but she was labled as a season 2 exclusive battle pass but look what happened.
560608399314780171,72,<@207315320313085952> same and I got Nocturno but I barely use it sadly.
560608600163090433,95,<@207315320313085952> I do like Nocturno its just I been using other guns. I kept it to Max 82.
560608881135583242,108,<@207315320313085952> it was my main since after canny valley. I used the Tommy gun more than any other gun.
