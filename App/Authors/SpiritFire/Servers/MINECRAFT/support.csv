560648100809670656,41,illl log in and try to post a block there
560648792194678785,86,i made a new world. now this is wierd. its fine when im logged in alone on the server.
560648935924826114,61,yea i deleted the old world when i updated the snapshot today
560649003859968010,54,let me log in on my wifes machine and check it out now
560649440499728404,57,lol!.. i dont know why.. but now its working.... *boggle*
560649750844669964,165,on a completely seperate note..  how do you make those darn pillagers go away. lol. this new world we started on.. they are right close by killing us over and over..
560649852242100224,49,they have a spawn box or a building i can destroy
560650011117879320,48,i kill them and they just respawn 1 minute later
560650061302726687,60,they are annoying the crap out of my family trying to play ðŸ˜„
560650193758978076,131,from the snapshot video i saw_ it says they can spawn where a village would spawn.. aka.. its either a village or a pillager spawn.
560650330015137804,152,the other two people playing are my wife and my mother. its gotten to the point they dont even want to play cuz they are dieing constantly to these guys
560650395467120641,61,their spawn point is almost next to the server start position
