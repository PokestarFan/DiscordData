558431501193052180,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,51,Links aren’t able to be put into minecraft text yet
558437630568693780,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,69,That could work_ but this is why we need to get a /permission command
558833140798586891,MINECRAFT,skins-n-textures,11,I need help
558833333963063306,MINECRAFT,skins-n-textures,0,
558833354615554062,MINECRAFT,skins-n-textures,52,Should the box indents be 1 pixel in or 2 pixels in?
558833930527047680,MINECRAFT,skins-n-textures,38,Minecraft textures are usually 16 x 16
558833981529784350,MINECRAFT,skins-n-textures,45,With exceptions like the sun or moon textures
558834043790163968,MINECRAFT,skins-n-textures,47,So just double that by numbers like 2 or 4 or 8
558834169698844682,MINECRAFT,skins-n-textures,60,So the image canvas could be 16 x 16_ 32 x 32_ 64 x 64_ etc.
558834368320372744,MINECRAFT,skins-n-textures,71,And sorry_ don’t know how to fix your face issue <@!304814785835302913>
558848938912776211,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,24,Not of the powered rails
560600275862290442,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,98,There’s so many bugs that someone’s been able to make a full series on bedrock bugs called bugrock
560600385874821150,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,4,Nat?
560600554943021056,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,8,Ah I see
560600700409610397,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,21,That’s on Xbox right?
560600733653794839,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,38,I haven’t had that issue on windows 10
560600740758814720,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,6,Oh oof
560600839031488522,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,4,Damn
560600934993100840,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,100,I’d honestly love a large fixing update where they go through all the bug reports and fix everything
560601042073419887,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,106,The spawning rates_ spawning issues_ the inconsistency with redstone_ crashes and performance issues_ etc.
560601269866332181,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,8,Why not?
560601360266035201,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,15,The randomness?
560601395821019139,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,18,That’s on purpose?
560601769483436033,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,114,So redstone runs better performance and memory wise because of the inconsistency of whether something works or not
560601990988693527,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,53,If the chunks don’t load then they would stop I think
560602547858046987,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,93,Alright but I’d still prefer a massive fixing update first instead of the new features coming
560602717530226699,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,23,Or at least both in one
560642454110470165,MINECRAFT,technical-bedrock,26,<@317080452777246740> yes#
