558437514357112832,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,62,it's a giant scam on every side and it delays so much progress
558437637220728844,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,82,Yes_ humans make it a scam_ but guess what religion is? A human made belief system

558466564802871328,r/teenagers,homework,113,it was so bad and so see through in terms of message that this paper is now 5 pages long and just full of insults
