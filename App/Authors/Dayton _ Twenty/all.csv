558436420205936691,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,108,The fact that there is nothing after death is the only reason why I can fathom why religion is still a thing
558436458399006751,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,59,It offers solace for the fact that nothing actually happens
558436633284706333,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,178,Yes but what's more realistic_ black nothingness after death like there was before birth or a giant man in the sky that sends people he loves unconditionally to burn for eternity
558436717502267424,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,84,idk_ my entire philosophy for religion is basically George Carlin's skit on religion
558436748003115013,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,20,I'm very anti-theist

558437514357112832,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,62,it's a giant scam on every side and it delays so much progress
558437637220728844,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,82,Yes_ humans make it a scam_ but guess what religion is? A human made belief system
558437744951558157,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,121,Not really religious freedom considering the people who moved to America persucuted anyone who didnt believe in their god

558438720290816011,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,88,But I'm aware that's like a major teenager hallmark so I'm probably gonna grow out of it
558438737525080064,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,31,But for now it's what i believe
558438977993048085,r/teenagers,serious-personal-2,71,My belief system is the bastardized child of Ayn Rand and George Carlin

558466564802871328,r/teenagers,homework,113,it was so bad and so see through in terms of message that this paper is now 5 pages long and just full of insults
