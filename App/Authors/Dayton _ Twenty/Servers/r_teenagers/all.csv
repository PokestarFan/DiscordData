558436349557080064,serious-personal-2,12,^^^^^^^^^^66
558436420205936691,serious-personal-2,108,The fact that there is nothing after death is the only reason why I can fathom why religion is still a thing
558436458399006751,serious-personal-2,59,It offers solace for the fact that nothing actually happens
558436633284706333,serious-personal-2,178,Yes but what's more realistic_ black nothingness after death like there was before birth or a giant man in the sky that sends people he loves unconditionally to burn for eternity
558436717502267424,serious-personal-2,84,idk_ my entire philosophy for religion is basically George Carlin's skit on religion
558436748003115013,serious-personal-2,20,I'm very anti-theist

558437059564666880,serious-personal-2,26,How'd the Carlin quote go?
558437107891175426,serious-personal-2,321,"Religion convinced the world that there's an invisible man in the sky who watches everything you do. And there's 10 things he doesn't want you to do or else you'll to to a burning place with a lake of fire until the end of eternity. But he loves you! ...And he needs money! He's all powerful_ but he can't handle money!"
558437382416891916,serious-personal-2,93,"He's all-powerful_ all-perfect_ all-knowing_ and all-wise_ somehow just can't handle money!”
558437445197234187,serious-personal-2,45,idk_ I'm just for the abolishment of religion
558437514357112832,serious-personal-2,62,it's a giant scam on every side and it delays so much progress
558437637220728844,serious-personal-2,82,Yes_ humans make it a scam_ but guess what religion is? A human made belief system
558437744951558157,serious-personal-2,121,Not really religious freedom considering the people who moved to America persucuted anyone who didnt believe in their god
558438147663462400,serious-personal-2,22,morality is just... eh

558438639483224065,serious-personal-2,29,I believe a lot of that stuff
558438720290816011,serious-personal-2,88,But I'm aware that's like a major teenager hallmark so I'm probably gonna grow out of it
558438737525080064,serious-personal-2,31,But for now it's what i believe
558438977993048085,serious-personal-2,71,My belief system is the bastardized child of Ayn Rand and George Carlin
558439040777584660,serious-personal-2,51,Those two had the biggest influence on me as I grew
558439090618630146,serious-personal-2,30,Oh yeah_ Thomas HObbes as well
558439125242609666,serious-personal-2,27,Always forget about him lol

558441949476945920,serious-personal,80,Makes life really easy if "friends" just drop me from the group over stupid shit
558441975037296641,serious-personal,48,and they then get pissed that I'm not hurt by it
558442141106307072,serious-personal,37,Just make sure you win if you do that

558442422892232705,serious-personal,55,Current generational trend is that people love assholes

558443620668276746,serious-personal,14,It really does
558443643984412727,serious-personal,45,You just need to learn to not care about them
558443675361738754,serious-personal,47,Learn to not give any form of a shit about them

558445393210507285,serious-personal,82,The classes and learning experiences_ at least_ are much better in hs than college
558445550291386368,serious-personal,38,party schools are a waste of money imo

558445976373690370,serious-personal,153,All I really truly care about right now is getting the best grades I can so that i can go to  a good grad school overseas and then teach in a high school
558446052756291586,serious-personal,30,That is my life plan as of now
558446211338862609,serious-personal,181,Maintain at least 3.4 GPA throughout college_ transfer to Trinity of Dublin_ Durham_ or even UofT_ get my masters in Edu and History_ then apply for a teaching position at my old hs

558446803440107556,serious-personal,93,Everything you learn in high school is integral to your life no matter what field you go into
558447012622762006,serious-personal,45,Its not the fact that it's GOING to be useful
558447040334659595,serious-personal,37,It's that it TEACHES YOU how to THINK
558447077093408770,serious-personal,55,Something which is vital to your life and is being lost
558447179375575042,serious-personal,128,I'm so flabbergasted by the fact people are saying English and History is useless when it couldn't be any farther from the truth
558447394165882961,serious-personal,73,Science_ Math_ History_ and English are the core of any form of education
558447418451034122,serious-personal,10,Not really
558447461082071070,serious-personal,77,English is reading_ but it's also learning how to write and argue effectively
558447493554372628,serious-personal,30,And gain reading comprehension
558447558079414272,serious-personal,97,You may have found Shakespeare useless_ but you learned how to dissect hard to understand writing
558447568300802048,serious-personal,21,That is a vital skill
558447604304838678,serious-personal,5,It is
558447614740267009,serious-personal,26,Yet so many people lack it
558447688316878884,serious-personal,1,^
558447777193918464,serious-personal,120,My favorite books are the ones we read in school because we talked so much about the meanings we never would have gotten

558447931699626004,serious-personal,47,Oh fuck Music is another major core of learning
558448000976814080,serious-personal,77,my school it's mandatory to play an instrument from 4th grade until 8th grade
558448042743693314,serious-personal,71,You can drop it then if you want_ but almost everyone continues with it
558448155838906370,serious-personal,43,Anthem is very symbolic with light_ yes Zam
558448169093169172,serious-personal,4,Yeah

558448627790381057,serious-personal,75,I'm shit at reading computer code_ but I can at least sort of understand it
558448671243370506,serious-personal,57,Computer Science was an option for a math credit at my HS
558448706698084355,serious-personal,55,Most kids took it because they thought it would be easy
558448728483037194,serious-personal,11,me included

558449113973260298,serious-personal,55,Shakespeare is one of the greatest writers in the world
558449169430216715,serious-personal,52,He has shaped how the english language works so much
558449202250907648,serious-personal,59,You use words that SHAKESPEARE himself created almost daily
558449323621482538,serious-personal,53,And they are useful for teaching ideas about concepts
558449377086275584,serious-personal,63,The Tempest and Titus Andronicus are very useful teaching tools
558449589850472448,serious-personal,43,It's to build an understanding of the world
558449647513894913,serious-personal,97,Every class you take is to further your understanding of the world and make you an actual citizen
558449710415872020,serious-personal,87,The old timey is the more relevant due to how much it shaped the world we live in today
558449793479737364,serious-personal,82,Shakespeare is the second most quoted "thing" on Earth_ he's only behind the Bible
558449851940077568,serious-personal,50,You cannot try to even argue how unimportant he is
558450009402507284,serious-personal,163,And I'm anti-theist but I think we should take courses on religion and the bible and stuff so that we can understand them due to the influence they have on society
558450158921187341,serious-personal,74,Broadening your perspectives should be and is mandatory_ at least in my hs
558450197919956992,serious-personal,43,But you DONT KNOW what you want to do in HS

558450585385304065,serious-personal,123,You get to at least have an understanding of what you want to do by having all of these broad classes in high school though
558450673860083725,serious-personal,140,A kid who wants to be a chemist will never know he wants to be a chemist_ maybe he wont even know he likes SCIENCE_ until he takes chemistry
558450771545554944,serious-personal,56,I think the bible should be taught in literature classes
558450856299593738,serious-personal,63,I think religion should be taught at a basic level for everyone

558451307481006082,serious-personal,69,That's another thing people should actually be able to understand imo
558451444659781632,serious-personal,122,I'd argue the American Education System is more modelled after the Liberal Arts Education of antiquity and the Renaissance
558451706476888064,serious-personal,69,The liberal arts are vital to create a well rounded individual though
558451749271371778,serious-personal,57,But I think music should be implemented into the lib arts
558451800072519680,serious-personal,75,That's another vital aspect of life as it gives an artistic outlet for kids
558451840685965342,serious-personal,36,Sciences are included under lib arts
558452028674670592,serious-personal,186,If you have a school have mandatory tech classes you'll only breed technicians who hate themselves because they're unhappy_ this is why tech classes are not mandatory but are an elective
558452135734280193,serious-personal,66,Well I mean tech is mandatory for one year in middle school for me
558452181951447045,serious-personal,58,Woodshop and Engineering was mandatory in 8th grade for me
558452321340751877,serious-personal,70,idk... I'm just sick of this generations aversion to actually learning
558452411589722122,serious-personal,58,Literature classes are full of "You actually _read_ that?"
558452448164052992,serious-personal,43,History classes are full of kids not caring
558452470091874315,serious-personal,44,Science classes are full of kids goofing off
558452489817554985,serious-personal,29,Math is full of kids sleeping
558452606846894099,serious-personal,73,PE is normally the only class kids like because they dont have to "learn"
558452643719020554,serious-personal,59,So I applaud the school for making working out fun for kids
558452979049431040,serious-personal,65,Gym/PE was mandatory legit from Kindergarten until I graduated HS
558453017465061386,serious-personal,2,Eh
558453031855718410,serious-personal,20,My gym class kids do
558453044522647552,serious-personal,16,1.5 mile warm up
558453069621493771,serious-personal,44,20 minutes in the workout room doing weights
558453089774862347,serious-personal,44,then the rest of the 80 minutes doing sports
558453173094973440,serious-personal,65,Oh yeah also_ did you have 80 minute classes or 40 minute classes
558453198709325827,serious-personal,51,Because 80 minute classes are actually a lot better
558453373293035540,serious-personal,83,You don't get enough time to learn and dissect the information in 40 minute classes
558453407451447334,serious-personal,14,Large classes?
558453412241604608,serious-personal,6,In HS?
558453423247327273,serious-personal,3,How
558453463953178625,serious-personal,60,Largest class in my HS that wasnt in the lecture hall was 20
558453503442419712,serious-personal,38,With the lecture hall it was almost 80
558453544076836885,serious-personal,25,80 minutes was phenomonal
558453567329927168,serious-personal,30,You got to dissect information
558453589106884636,serious-personal,34,Also you had 2 days to do homework
558453625144213520,serious-personal,52,Since you never had the same class two days in a row
558453639140737044,serious-personal,18,Except for science
558453725820223488,serious-personal,65,Science and Gym were on a schedule of Science-Sci-Gym-Sci-Sci-Gym
558453777158635520,serious-personal,29,We have classes every day too
558453829071273995,serious-personal,45,when I was still in HS it was 4 classes a day
558453870691352577,serious-personal,18,You took 8 classes
558453889095958538,serious-personal,24,But they were spread out
558453934717665290,serious-personal,37,Math could be 2 or 3 days a week only
558453950794170378,serious-personal,12,instead of 5
558454022017646613,serious-personal,42,Gym could be 2 days a week or 1 day a week

558454383486959629,serious-personal,31,That was my schedule 11th grade
558454402520842240,serious-personal,24,Just missing PE and Math
558454518400942080,serious-personal,31,https://i.imgur.com/lyOem5G.png
558454535706771476,serious-personal,23,Likewise for 12th grade
558454554165772299,serious-personal,10,Missing PE
558454588236103680,serious-personal,61,I took a study hall instead of anotehr elective in 12th grade
558454614479863809,serious-personal,16,It's interesting
558454666833428501,serious-personal,25,Taught me to manage money
558454699477565452,serious-personal,33,Made me understand how taxes work
558454727700906004,serious-personal,27,How the national debt works
558454781316694016,serious-personal,37,PiG is Participation in Goverment btw
558454855878967306,serious-personal,83,so we learned how global gov works_ how national gov works_ and how local gov works
558454955367727115,serious-personal,82,we took a field trip to DC to see the senate building and got to meet people there
558455004109864970,serious-personal,55,Those are 2 classes that should be mandatory everywhere
558455029862891520,serious-personal,12,PiG and Econ
558455097521209345,serious-personal,32,12th yes_ 11th was the other one

558455272293793803,serious-personal,35,Now you look at my college schedule
558455292669722656,serious-personal,42,and it's not even close to as well rounded
558455322524778497,serious-personal,43,And it's so much worse than my HS education
558455346251825152,serious-personal,27,Classes are only 50 minutes

558455898914291732,serious-personal,119,Only interesting class of first semester was my writing class because you can always learn new stuff in writing classes
558455942560219136,serious-personal,74,The history and gov classes were just rehashing everything i learned in hs
558456084457717760,serious-personal,227,second semester the only good class is theatre and lit because I never took a theatre class before and the history and how theatre works is really fun to learn about_ and lit because I love reading and dissecting literary works
558456118804742165,serious-personal,29,I'm biased for reading though
558456179353845770,serious-personal,96,My dad used to force me and my siblings to read books over summer and write book reports for him

558468195170910209,serious-personal,5,_fun_
558468623438446592,serious-personal,61,Because apparently giving a shit about how you look = you gay
558468663208968193,serious-personal,58,Also the fact I have more female friends than male friensd
558468778225303562,serious-personal,105,Like I'm sorry I always make sure my hair is done well and that I wear button up shirts and leather shoes
558468791026319360,serious-personal,28,But that doesn't make me gay
558469184263290885,serious-personal,130,It doesn't bother me that much but I just hate the connotation of dressing well/having more female friends than male friends = gay
558469253548998660,serious-personal,54,I don't like streetwear dammit_ I like business casual
558469386336469001,serious-personal,45,I really only have my GF and my family rn lol
558469399795990558,serious-personal,28,That friend group dropped me
558469436554608640,serious-personal,50,My sister has always been my closest friend though
558469601868906508,serious-personal,166,I trust my sister more than I trust my own gf rn_ but thats just because I can't trust someone as much as I trust my sister when we've only been together for 6 months
558469723805712389,serious-personal,38,I also just dont give out trust easily
558469743447900161,serious-personal,26,I really only trust family
558469834313039872,serious-personal,77,It took me until we were in 5 months in until I told my gf that I trusted her
558469864751235073,serious-personal,37,And I still don't trust her fully lol
