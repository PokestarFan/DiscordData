558428629923790848,50,Closest to an ivy I could get are the Public Ivies
558428680636858369,60,I did get into a Little Ivy but I can't afford the education

558429419254054912,5,what?
558429449771548690,26,Can't relate with this lol
558429854568153100,75,The closest to an acid trip I will get is listening to Echoes by Pink Floyd
558430504282619918,5,it is
558430546074533918,50,My aura is shit because I already have visual snow
558430586033799180,45,So when a migraine shows up it just is horrid
558430672218488834,16,Sleep paralysis?
558430702400438294,2,ah
558431141481414667,72,Darkness is horrible because my visual snow peaks and I get a light show
558431307005296661,32,I have to sleep with my phone on
558431341201588225,39,Normally listen to ASMR or smth calming
558431369177464865,19,Tinnitus is a bitch
558431651047145473,23,I'm basically like Baby
558431691320983552,62,Earbuds in most of the time with music on to help drown it out
558432244390297613,71,https://i.imgur.com/mpYwKfr.png yeah this is as loud as I put music now
558432252921511937,16,with speakers on
558432264623489044,20,It's not loud at all
558432315009925131,35,You probably don't work on 2 easily
558432330017013760,29,Your body just got used to it
558432394005315620,94,I thought I could handle 2 or 4 just fine_ then college hit and now I'm getting 7-9 each night
558432526503378944,36,ASMR is all I listen to when I sleep
558432613388386336,53,PC sounds on 50%_ spotify on 50% vol with speakers on
558432648796700672,42,the music is audible but still quite quiet
558432850915885066,38,Right now_ with how my sound is set up
558432884743077889,39,my laptop is putting out sound at 50 db
558432905207218196,20,so_ its really quiet
558440478958288906,75,People just need to learn to not give a fuck and care about only themselves
558440489423077406,25,Makes life so much easier
558440617898934282,27,I used to be a regular here
558440629076754443,18,like... a year ago
558441180812017684,14,Twenty I think
558441209182420992,11,Twenty#8833
558441311032574006,5,I did
558441364686110740,59,that acct is also banned because me and friends were stupid
558441647827058688,29,Just say fuck you to his face
558441860109041674,101,I follow my dad's advice... basically "only care about yourself and your family_ no one else matters"
558441949476945920,80,Makes life really easy if "friends" just drop me from the group over stupid shit
558441975037296641,48,and they then get pissed that I'm not hurt by it
558442141106307072,37,Just make sure you win if you do that
558442225433051136,43,Nah an ass beating works wonders most times
558442233410617358,20,You just have to win
558442422892232705,55,Current generational trend is that people love assholes
558442556749512714,105,Right now people love assholes_ people love anti-intellectualism and being dumb_ and people love fakeness
558442580749320195,30,At least this is what I notice
558442903890952193,35,I mean I just hate everyone equally
558443017506258994,126,I hate blacks I hate whites I hate asians I hate jews I hate christians I hate athiests I hate smart people I hate dumb people
558443061902966795,23,I hate everyone equally
558443164818472980,50,Only people I like are my family members and my SO
558443189632106498,46,Those are the only people that actually matter
558443227464859679,3,^^^
558443383732043776,110,"The opposite of love is indifference. If you hate someone that means you care enough about them to hate them"
558443469769539595,32,See I'll disagree with you there
558443620668276746,14,It really does
558443643984412727,45,You just need to learn to not care about them
558443675361738754,47,Learn to not give any form of a shit about them
558443698074157067,30,Don't care if they live or die
558443752901836801,47,Don't care if they're in school or sick at home
558443776411172884,17,Just _don't care_
558444616941043742,27,We get on average 8 decades
558444633596887071,31,You've almost wasted 2 of those
558444863276843048,29,thats why we say _On average_
558445300788887555,61,High School is better than college right now in my experience
558445393210507285,82,The classes and learning experiences_ at least_ are much better in hs than college
558445550291386368,38,party schools are a waste of money imo
558445562882424832,29,I'm going to college to learn
558445585745838080,31,not to waste time getting drunk
558445606276694016,31,I've legit yet to go to a party
558445651965509664,10,not really
558445717023096862,32,I've branched out and met people
558445742302167060,39,Formed a small friend group_ have an SO
558445750665871401,11,I'm content
558445809209835547,113,Now I want to transfer to go to a college with better learning experiences because I want to be a history teacher
558445976373690370,153,All I really truly care about right now is getting the best grades I can so that i can go to  a good grad school overseas and then teach in a high school
558446052756291586,30,That is my life plan as of now
558446211338862609,181,Maintain at least 3.4 GPA throughout college_ transfer to Trinity of Dublin_ Durham_ or even UofT_ get my masters in Edu and History_ then apply for a teaching position at my old hs
558446292469022720,19,You probanly wouldn
558446343165837352,29,Jail gives you free amenities
558446364892069908,22,Poor gives you nothing
558446430872666143,14,Don't say that
558446450510659625,16,You really can't
558446466822045696,14,Stay in school
558446497855963146,28,Learn to live_ live to learn
558446509666861056,27,Learn to think and question
558446547075858432,35,then go to college_ learn even more
558446714885767178,61,Same_ and being screamed at by my father helped me understand
558446803440107556,93,Everything you learn in high school is integral to your life no matter what field you go into
558447012622762006,45,Its not the fact that it's GOING to be useful
558447040334659595,37,It's that it TEACHES YOU how to THINK
558447077093408770,55,Something which is vital to your life and is being lost
558447179375575042,128,I'm so flabbergasted by the fact people are saying English and History is useless when it couldn't be any farther from the truth
558447394165882961,73,Science_ Math_ History_ and English are the core of any form of education
558447418451034122,10,Not really
558447461082071070,77,English is reading_ but it's also learning how to write and argue effectively
558447493554372628,30,And gain reading comprehension
558447558079414272,97,You may have found Shakespeare useless_ but you learned how to dissect hard to understand writing
558447568300802048,21,That is a vital skill
558447604304838678,5,It is
558447614740267009,26,Yet so many people lack it
558447688316878884,1,^
558447777193918464,120,My favorite books are the ones we read in school because we talked so much about the meanings we never would have gotten
558447802045300736,36,Great Gatsby_ Scarlet Letter_ Anthem
558447931699626004,47,Oh fuck Music is another major core of learning
558448000976814080,77,my school it's mandatory to play an instrument from 4th grade until 8th grade
558448042743693314,71,You can drop it then if you want_ but almost everyone continues with it
558448155838906370,43,Anthem is very symbolic with light_ yes Zam
558448169093169172,4,Yeah
558448192908296198,36,3rd grade mandatory recorder lessons
558448235195269120,44,4th grade you can go into band_ or orchestra
558448268107841547,54,And chorus is mandatory from 5th grade until 7th grade
558448536950407178,75,You can't be a citizen if you don't know history and you don't know english
558448627790381057,75,I'm shit at reading computer code_ but I can at least sort of understand it
558448671243370506,57,Computer Science was an option for a math credit at my HS
558448706698084355,55,Most kids took it because they thought it would be easy
558448728483037194,11,me included
558448815254798337,27,Thats fucking retarded okay
558448960415727627,50,idk_ I'm very classical in my education philosohpy
558449003339972609,62,I don't like how school is becoming more and more of a daycare
558449113973260298,55,Shakespeare is one of the greatest writers in the world
558449169430216715,52,He has shaped how the english language works so much
558449202250907648,59,You use words that SHAKESPEARE himself created almost daily
558449323621482538,53,And they are useful for teaching ideas about concepts
558449377086275584,63,The Tempest and Titus Andronicus are very useful teaching tools
558449589850472448,43,It's to build an understanding of the world
558449647513894913,97,Every class you take is to further your understanding of the world and make you an actual citizen
558449710415872020,87,The old timey is the more relevant due to how much it shaped the world we live in today
558449793479737364,82,Shakespeare is the second most quoted "thing" on Earth_ he's only behind the Bible
558449851940077568,50,You cannot try to even argue how unimportant he is
558450009402507284,163,And I'm anti-theist but I think we should take courses on religion and the bible and stuff so that we can understand them due to the influence they have on society
558450158921187341,74,Broadening your perspectives should be and is mandatory_ at least in my hs
558450197919956992,43,But you DONT KNOW what you want to do in HS
558450254555643934,61,SO MANY PEOPLE switch their majors once they get into college
558450278425296896,1,^
558450375670235156,57,A lib arts education  should be mandatory for all schools
558450407987478528,45,it actually creates a well rounded individual
558450585385304065,123,You get to at least have an understanding of what you want to do by having all of these broad classes in high school though
558450673860083725,140,A kid who wants to be a chemist will never know he wants to be a chemist_ maybe he wont even know he likes SCIENCE_ until he takes chemistry
558450771545554944,56,I think the bible should be taught in literature classes
558450856299593738,63,I think religion should be taught at a basic level for everyone
558451012914905089,79,But you DONT attain a college level understanding unless you GO INTO THAT FIELD
558451086348910598,91,I'm taking basic college history courses right now and these classes have taught me nothing
558451145069297684,69,I've learned everything I've learned from basic 10th grade US History
558451247062056971,34,You should still have anthropology
558451307481006082,69,That's another thing people should actually be able to understand imo
558451444659781632,122,I'd argue the American Education System is more modelled after the Liberal Arts Education of antiquity and the Renaissance
558451706476888064,69,The liberal arts are vital to create a well rounded individual though
558451749271371778,57,But I think music should be implemented into the lib arts
558451800072519680,75,That's another vital aspect of life as it gives an artistic outlet for kids
558451840685965342,36,Sciences are included under lib arts
558452028674670592,186,If you have a school have mandatory tech classes you'll only breed technicians who hate themselves because they're unhappy_ this is why tech classes are not mandatory but are an elective
558452135734280193,66,Well I mean tech is mandatory for one year in middle school for me
558452181951447045,58,Woodshop and Engineering was mandatory in 8th grade for me
558452321340751877,70,idk... I'm just sick of this generations aversion to actually learning
558452411589722122,58,Literature classes are full of "You actually _read_ that?"
558452448164052992,43,History classes are full of kids not caring
558452470091874315,44,Science classes are full of kids goofing off
558452489817554985,29,Math is full of kids sleeping
558452606846894099,73,PE is normally the only class kids like because they dont have to "learn"
558452643719020554,59,So I applaud the school for making working out fun for kids
558452979049431040,65,Gym/PE was mandatory legit from Kindergarten until I graduated HS
558453017465061386,2,Eh
558453031855718410,20,My gym class kids do
558453044522647552,16,1.5 mile warm up
558453069621493771,44,20 minutes in the workout room doing weights
558453089774862347,44,then the rest of the 80 minutes doing sports
558453173094973440,65,Oh yeah also_ did you have 80 minute classes or 40 minute classes
558453198709325827,51,Because 80 minute classes are actually a lot better
558453373293035540,83,You don't get enough time to learn and dissect the information in 40 minute classes
558453407451447334,14,Large classes?
558453412241604608,6,In HS?
558453423247327273,3,How
558453463953178625,60,Largest class in my HS that wasnt in the lecture hall was 20
558453503442419712,38,With the lecture hall it was almost 80
558453544076836885,25,80 minutes was phenomonal
558453567329927168,30,You got to dissect information
558453589106884636,34,Also you had 2 days to do homework
558453625144213520,52,Since you never had the same class two days in a row
558453639140737044,18,Except for science
558453725820223488,65,Science and Gym were on a schedule of Science-Sci-Gym-Sci-Sci-Gym
558453777158635520,29,We have classes every day too
558453829071273995,45,when I was still in HS it was 4 classes a day
558453870691352577,18,You took 8 classes
558453889095958538,24,But they were spread out
558453934717665290,37,Math could be 2 or 3 days a week only
558453950794170378,12,instead of 5
558454022017646613,42,Gym could be 2 days a week or 1 day a week
558454366978441244,31,https://i.imgur.com/1i1jrkO.png
558454383486959629,31,That was my schedule 11th grade
558454402520842240,24,Just missing PE and Math
558454518400942080,31,https://i.imgur.com/lyOem5G.png
558454535706771476,23,Likewise for 12th grade
558454554165772299,10,Missing PE
558454588236103680,61,I took a study hall instead of anotehr elective in 12th grade
558454614479863809,16,It's interesting
558454666833428501,25,Taught me to manage money
558454699477565452,33,Made me understand how taxes work
558454727700906004,27,How the national debt works
558454781316694016,37,PiG is Participation in Goverment btw
558454855878967306,83,so we learned how global gov works_ how national gov works_ and how local gov works
558454955367727115,82,we took a field trip to DC to see the senate building and got to meet people there
558455004109864970,55,Those are 2 classes that should be mandatory everywhere
558455029862891520,12,PiG and Econ
558455097521209345,32,12th yes_ 11th was the other one
558455246591098892,31,https://i.imgur.com/9boSntL.png
558455272293793803,35,Now you look at my college schedule
558455292669722656,42,and it's not even close to as well rounded
558455322524778497,43,And it's so much worse than my HS education
558455346251825152,27,Classes are only 50 minutes
558455371199414287,18,its legit horrible
558455440783048705,24,Lib arts college in Mass
558455475327336459,31,https://i.imgur.com/HDqcmfF.png
558455500933562408,35,This was my first semester schedule
558455595003543562,22,Still utterly horrible
558455898914291732,119,Only interesting class of first semester was my writing class because you can always learn new stuff in writing classes
558455942560219136,74,The history and gov classes were just rehashing everything i learned in hs
558456084457717760,227,second semester the only good class is theatre and lit because I never took a theatre class before and the history and how theatre works is really fun to learn about_ and lit because I love reading and dissecting literary works
558456118804742165,29,I'm biased for reading though
558456179353845770,96,My dad used to force me and my siblings to read books over summer and write book reports for him
558456205354205198,36,If we didn't do them we got grounded
558456314104381450,92,Summer going into 12th grade I read Don Quixote and wrote like a 10 page report on that book
558456340188758036,23,Such a good book though

558463222500294676,43,I find Wrestling creates the best community
558463313839783937,99,Because you're all starving and pissed at the coach and angry and it creates a wonderful envronment

558468186681376786,150,So I just found out that my old friend group thought I was gay until I got with my gf_ and they still think I'm gay and I just got with her as a cover
558468195170910209,5,_fun_
558468623438446592,61,Because apparently giving a shit about how you look = you gay
558468663208968193,58,Also the fact I have more female friends than male friensd
558468778225303562,105,Like I'm sorry I always make sure my hair is done well and that I wear button up shirts and leather shoes
558468791026319360,28,But that doesn't make me gay
558469184263290885,130,It doesn't bother me that much but I just hate the connotation of dressing well/having more female friends than male friends = gay
558469253548998660,54,I don't like streetwear dammit_ I like business casual
558469386336469001,45,I really only have my GF and my family rn lol
558469399795990558,28,That friend group dropped me
558469436554608640,50,My sister has always been my closest friend though
558469601868906508,166,I trust my sister more than I trust my own gf rn_ but thats just because I can't trust someone as much as I trust my sister when we've only been together for 6 months
558469723805712389,38,I also just dont give out trust easily
558469743447900161,26,I really only trust family
558469834313039872,77,It took me until we were in 5 months in until I told my gf that I trusted her
558469864751235073,37,And I still don't trust her fully lol
558469982753914895,112,I know my mom asked my dad when they were together for a year if he trusted her and he straight up said "no" lol
560644129810284544,46,Hey so I just fully threatened to kill someone
560644191022219284,87,Is it possible to admit myself to ER for mental reasons because I feel unsafe right now
