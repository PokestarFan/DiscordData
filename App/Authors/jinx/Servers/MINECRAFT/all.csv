559044719976513547,minecraft,67,Phones can't handle shaders because they would probably fry the GPU

559044819994017802,minecraft,42,At least the kind of shaders you see on PC

559045131970543616,minecraft,32,I hope 1.14 is better optimized.
559045193538600970,minecraft,84,I don't mind optifine but I'd prefer if the game it's well optimized out of the box.

559046083641344051,minecraft,62,I wish windows 10 edition had a less pocket edition UI though.
